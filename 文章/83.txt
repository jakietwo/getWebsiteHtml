"Everything, everything gonna be alright this morning…”
 I can’t just play one version of the sublime Muddy Waters performing “Mannish Boy.” Yesterday’s epic romp with Muddy and the Stones at the Checkerboard Lounge wasn’t enough. “I’m a rollin’ stone…Man!”
 I’ll never forget Muddy and The Band performing “Mannish Boy” during Scorsese’s epic concert film of “The Last Waltz.” It’s primal. The intensity. The way the camera pans in on Muddy. Garth Hudson’s organ simmering beneath the surface. Paul Butterfield on harp. Robbie looking so cool. But not as cool as Muddy. He, Muddy, was the man.
