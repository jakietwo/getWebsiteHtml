iDeas Lab 
 Several countries and non-state actors are developing, or have already developed, counterspace weapons that could be used against vulnerable U.S. space assets.  A new report from the CSIS Aerospace Security Project  assesses open-source information and analyzes what space and counterspace assets China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, and other actors are developing.
The Andreas C. Dracopoulos iDeas Lab at CSIS enhances our research with the latest in cutting-edge web technologies, design, and video.

Around the world, governments are using a variety of approaches—ranging from controlling the media, creating onerous registration requirements, and passing restrictive legislation to cut off foreign funding, to depriving human rights activists of their nationality, detaining civil society leaders, and in some cases, engaging in targeted killing—to limit the space for civil society to operate.  Watch   a     new explainer video on civil society  from the CSIS Human Rights Initiative.
Sounds 
North Korea is the impossible state. For over 45 years no American president has figured it out. Now, the stakes may be higher than ever as Donald Trump and the Trump administration come to the negotiating table. Each week join the people who know the most about North Korea—CSIS's Victor Cha, Mike Green, and Sue Mi Terry—for an insider’s discussion with host H. Andrew Schwartz (that's me) about the United States’ top national security priority.  Listen to the trailer here.

Rock and Roll FM radio was once a primary mover of American culture and in cities all over this land it provided a sense of community. Radio in general still reaches a large audience, about 54 percent of the U.S. population daily according to Statista, but it’s fragmented, with news/talk radio taking up a big listenership.
 Rock stations are still important in some places—I love listening to FM rock radio in Los Angeles or Cleveland for example. It’s still soulful in those cities and it still feels like the radio stations know their audience. But in DC, rock radio is dead. I now listen to Spotify and to Sirius XM with all of its specialized channels.
 Growing up in DC, the big rock radio stations were DC 101 and WHFS. They provided the soundtrack of our lives. And Tuesdays, were always “Two for Tuesdays” on DC 101. As in, “Sweet Home Alabama” and “Free Bird” from Skynyrd or “Black Dog” and “Stairway to Heaven” from Zeppelin.
 So in that spirit, let’s do two from The Who:
