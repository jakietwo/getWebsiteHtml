 It’s Carnival Time in New Orleans. Among other things, that means that the music in the Big Easy is firing on all cylinders. Today is Lundi Gras when the music around town hits its collective peak. Tomorrow is Mardi Gras Day, also known as “Fat Tuesday” when the biggest parades roll.
 This clip is from Jazz Fest in 2000, when Art Neville and the Funky Meters were firing on all cylinders. Happy Mardi Gras to all my people at Tulane and in New Orleans and to lovers of the Crescent City sound the world over.
