        UN Security Council Passes New Resolution 2094 on North Korea
March 7, 2013In response to North Korea's  third nuclear test conducted on February 12, the UN Security Council  unanimously passed a new resolution on March 7 to impose additional sanctions  on the country. Resolution 2094 is the fifth UNSCR against North Korea since  2006 for the country’s nuclear and ballistic missile activities in violation of  previous Security Council resolutions 1695, 1718, 1874, and 2087. Susan E.  Rice, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, stated that Resolution 2094 is  designed to “significantly impede North Korea's ability to develop further its  illicit nuclear and ballistic missile programs, as well as its proliferation  activities.”
The new measure’s passage  proceeded smoothly and quickly even in the face of North Korea’s aggressive and  more provocative statements. Earlier this week, North Korea declared the 1953  armistice accord that ended the Korean War null and void. Hours before the  announcement of the sanctions, North Korea increased its hostility with threats  of war and by warning of a preemptive nuclear strike against the United States  and South Korea.
Q1: What’s  in the new resolution? What is the significance of these new sanctions compared  to the previous ones?
A1: One major aspect of the new  resolution is that it has tightened financial sanctions by making some of the  existing measures mandatory. Under the new resolution, 193 member states are  now required to “freeze or block” any financial transactions or monetary  transfers if such activities are deemed to help North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic  missile programs. Financial support for trade with North Korea that could  assist its illicit programs is also prohibited. The new financial measures are  aimed at cracking down on bulk cash transfers and also restricting the  financial network of North Korean banks involved in the country’s illicit  activities. In addition, interdiction and inspection of all suspicious ships  and cargos also became mandatory, a notable development since China and Russia  had opposed to making such measures mandatory in the past. For the first time,  the Security Council expanded the scope of its target to include North Korean  diplomats in order to monitor their involvement in illegal activities. The  Security Council also blacklisted two additional entities and three more  individuals for travel bans and asset freezes.
Q2: Was  this the harshest resolution that could be imposed on North Korea? 
A2: No. Resolution 2094 and other  previous resolutions (1718, 1874, and 2087) were passed under Chapter 7,  Article 41 of the UN Charter under which measures are limited to those without  use of armed forces. Such measures include economic and financial sanctions,  restriction and prohibition of travel and other communication methods, and the  severance of diplomatic relations. A more serious and harsher resolution would  have been for the UNSC to invoke Chapter 7, Article 42 under which UN member  countries are allowed to use air, sea, or land forces to enforce sanctions.
Q3: Does  China’s support of the new sanctions means a growing shift in its North Korea’s  policy? 
A3: Still unclear. China has  supported previous UNSCRs in the wake of North Korea’s two nuclear tests.  Although China clearly opposes North Korea’s nuclear tests, maintaining the  status quo remains its main priority. All parties seem to be content with the  resolution but partly because we have been socialized into expecting so little  from China that there’s excitment when China shows even a bit of sternness. The  real test of China’s commitment will be in the follow-through. Will it not just  sign on to sanctions, but will it enforce them with vigor? In the past,  China-DPRK trade has increased in the aftermath of UN sanctions. One hopes that  this will not be the case again.
Q4: What  is North Korea’s likely response?
A4: Expect a North Korean  provocation in the coming weeks. First, the country has already threatened  suspension of the 1953 Korean War armistice, including severing its military  hotline with the United States and suspending the activities of its  representative office at Panmunjom. Second, its rhetoric is at a fever pitch  with threats of preemptive nuclear attacks against the United States. Third,  North Korea has blasted ongoing annual U.S.-South Korea military exercises,  including the start of Key Resolve beginning Monday, March 11. Fourth, it has  declared no-sail, no-fly zones in the East Sea and Yellow Sea, which are  telltale signs of more missile tests. Finally, our research at CSIS shows that  the North does a military provocation of some form within weeks of every South  Korean presidential inauguration dating back to 1992 (South Korean president  Park Guen-hye was inaugurated into office on February 25). Not a good prospect  at all.
Q5: Are  North Korean threats of nuclear preemptive attacks credible?
A5: So far, North Korea has neither  demonstrated nor deployed a nuclear weapons-capable ICBM that could reach the  United States. However, its latest missile test (December 2012) and nuclear  test (February 2013) appear to demonstrate significant advancements in  technology that show the regime is well on the way to developing such a  capability, possibly within the term of the current American president. They  already possess hundreds of deployed Nodong missiles that could hit U.S. bases  in Japan and South Korea. North Korea also has a record of selling their  weapons technology to Libya, Syria, Iran, and Pakistan. Given these factors,  any national security expert takes no comfort in the hope that these threats could  be empty.
