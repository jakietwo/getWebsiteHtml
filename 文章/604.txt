        A Tumultuous 2016 in the South China Sea
February 18, 2016This promises to be a landmark year for the claimant countries and other interested parties in the South China Sea disputes. Developments that have been     under way for several years, especially China’s island-building campaign in the Spratlys and Manila’s arbitration case against Beijing, will come to     fruition. These and other developments will draw outside players, including the United States, Japan, Australia, and India, into greater involvement.     Meanwhile a significant increase in Chinese forces and capabilities will lead to more frequent run-ins with neighbors.
Alongside these developments, important political transitions will take place around the region and further afield, especially the Philippine presidential     elections in May. But no matter who emerges as Manila’s next leader, his or her ability to substantially alter course on the South China Sea will be highly     constrained by the emergence of the issue as a cause célèbre among many Filipinos who view Beijing with wariness bordering on outright fear. The same dynamics are at play in Vietnam, where the course of South China Sea policy is    not expected to change following     last month’s Communist Party congress despite the re-election of Nguyen Phu Trong, who is generally seen as more pro-Beijing, as party chief.
A Ruling from The Hague
The Philippines argued the merits of its case against China’s claims in the South China Sea     before an arbitral tribunal at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague in November 2015. Afterward the five judges asked the Philippine legal team     for written answers to a final round of follow-up questions. They are now expected to enter deliberations and issue a ruling around late May. That decision     will be final and legally binding on both parties, despite Beijing’s refusal to take part in the proceedings or recognize the tribunal’s jurisdiction.
The case is complicated—it consists of 15 separate claims—and so the final shape of an award from the tribunal is unknown. However, the judges will almost     certainly rule that China’s nine-dash line is not a valid maritime claim and that China is not entitled to any historic rights beyond the regime of     territorial seas, exclusive economic zones, and continental shelves laid out in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). This will not     affect China’s territorial claims to the disputed islands and rocks of the South China Sea, nor will it necessarily mean that Beijing cannot make large     claims to the seabed and waters in the area. But it will amount to an order that China clarify its maritime claims based on entitlements from land     features, not ambiguous dashes on a map.
Beijing will not suddenly clarify its claims in the South China Sea because the tribunal orders it to do so. The Chinese government has repeatedly said     that it will not recognize any ruling. But it has also worked hard since Manila brought the case in early 2013 to get the Philippine government to drop it.     That is because being branded an international outlaw will involve significant reputational costs for Beijing. It will undermine China’s narrative that it     is a responsible rising power that deserves a greater hand in global governance. It will make other countries wary of Chinese commitments and will drive     regional states even closer to Tokyo and Washington.
These costs to Beijing could make an eventual political compromise more appealing. China might agree to redefine the nine-dash line based on UNCLOS rather     than historic rights and enter real negotiations in exchange for the Philippines dropping the case (which will remain open until both parties abide by the     award) and agreeing to undertake joint economic development.
To promote that kind of political compromise, Manila and Washington will need to embark on a sustained campaign to garner international support for the     tribunal’s ruling. That support will need to come not only from like-minded countries like Australia, Japan, and European states, but also from the     Philippines’ Southeast Asian neighbors.
China’s first civilian test flights landed at Fiery Cross Reef at the end of 2015, marking the completion of China’s first operational runway in the     Spratly Islands. Additional airstrips at Subi Reef and Mischief Reef will soon join it, if     they have not already, and military test flights to the features are expected in the first half of 2016. Meanwhile China continues to build port     facilities, support structures, and radar installations to support substantial air, naval, and coast guard forces on rotation at these and four other     features in the Spratlys. Add to this ongoing military upgrades at Woody Island, where China boasts another airstrip and recently deployed mobile     surface-to-air missiles, and it is clear that 2016 will see the capabilities of Chinese forces in the South China Sea increase substantially.
The most direct victims of this increase in Chinese forces over the course of 2016 will be the naval, coast guard, and civilian fleets of Southeast Asian     claimants. Simple arithmetic suggests that this year will see more frequent harassment of and clashes with Filipino, Malaysian, and Vietnamese fishermen,     oil and gas exploration vessels, and military ships and planes as China increases its capacity to patrol more of the South China Sea and interdict vessels     operating in what Beijing considers its sovereign space.
Increased Chinese naval and air capabilities in the South China Sea are already leading to calls from Southeast Asian claimants for greater involvement by     outside powers. These voices will only grow louder as 2016 progresses and more Chinese facilities in the Spratlys come online. Already Australia has     stepped up patrols under its Operation Gateway—an ongoing mission to patrol Southeast Asian waters and airspace—as the United States increases the     frequency of its freedom of navigation patrols in the area.
Japan is stepping up defense cooperation with regional partners, especially Australia and the Philippines, under its new defense guidelines and is hotly     debating a larger role in patrolling the South China Sea. And the Indian navy is increasingly operating in the area while emerging as a key provider of     arms and equipment to Vietnam and an increasingly important security partner to Australia, Japan, and the United States.
The ability of the United States to boost its intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and patrol capabilities in the South China Sea, and to respond in case of threats to the Philippines or other regional partners, will be significantly increased by the Philippine Supreme Court’s approval in January of the    Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement. In the coming months,     Manila and Washington will finalize the official list of Philippine military facilities to which U.S. forces will gain access as part of the agreement, and     in which the United States will invest substantially to improve Philippine military infrastructure.
Given these dynamics, 2016 promises to be a much tenser year in the South China Sea, but one in which the groundwork could be laid for a sustained     multilateral campaign to deter further Chinese aggression, support Southeast Asian states in pursuit of their rights, and reach an eventual political     compromise to manage the disputes.
