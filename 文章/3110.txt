        China's Rise
Challenges and OpportunitiesSeptember 23, 2008ISBN# 978-0-88132-417-4 (hb)China has emerged as an economic powerhouse (projected to have the largest economy in the world in a little over a decade) and is taking an ever-increasing role on the world stage. China’s Rise: Challenges and Opportunities will help the United States and the rest of the world better comprehend the facts and dynamics underpinning China’s rise—an understanding that becomes more and more important with each passing day. Additionally, the authors suggest actions both China and the United States can take that will not only maximize the opportunities for China’s constructive integration into the international community but also help form a domestic consensus that will provide a stable foundation for such policies. Filled with facts for policymakers, the book’s narrative-driven, accessible style will appeal to the general reader.

The expert judgments in this book paint a picture of a China confronting domestic challenges that are in many ways side effects of its economic successes, while simultaneously trying to take advantage of the foreign policy benefits of those same successes. China’s Rise—a product of the China Balance Sheet Project, a joint, multiyear project of the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) and the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE)— discusses China’s military modernization; China’s increasing soft power influence in Asia and around the world; China’s policy toward Taiwan; China’s domestic political development; Beijing’s political relations with China’s provincial and municipal authorities; corruption and social unrest in China; rebalancing China’s economic growth; the exchange rate controversy; energy and the environment; industrial policy; trade disputes; and investment issues. The book’s introduction and conclusion address additional issues, such as key trends in China’s political decisionmaking and its impact on U.S. interests.
