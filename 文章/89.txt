Again—and Again and Again
February 25, 2019
    I tried to resist the temptation to talk about China this week, but it is
    simply too big and too timely a topic to pass up, even though we are at
    best only at Act III in the drama. The pace of negotiations has heated up,
    and both sides have expressed optimism that this will have a happy ending
    once the two presidents meet. So far, there have been surprisingly few
    leaks about what is going on. Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said on Friday
    that agreement on a currency provision had been reached, although he
    provided no details. In addition, rumored details of increased Chinese
    purchases of U.S. products have been dribbling out for weeks, but that's
    about it. The above rumors are probably true. Buying more U.S. products is
    the easiest thing China can do, and a commitment not to manipulate currency
    is something both sides have said would be a good thing. (There are ironies
    there, however. If what the United States really wants is a promise not to
    let the RMB depreciate above seven to the dollar, then we are essentially
    asking them to manipulate their currency but in our favor rather than
    theirs. That is not exactly a strong defense of market principles.)


    More difficult to parse is progress on the so-called structural
    issues—those related to intellectual property theft, forced technology
    transfer, and various derogations from market principles like subsidies and
    support for state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Most non-government observers
    believe the two sides remain far apart on those and the associated
    enforcement provisions, even though there is a growing feeling that this
    exercise will ultimately end in an agreement, which, of course, the
    president will tout as the greatest ever regardless of its contents.


    At this point, I believe the most likely outcome is that the Chinese give
    us some, but not all, of what we have been asking for by making commitments
    on IP theft, forced technology transfer, opening investment in China, and
    agreeing to do away with various forms of discrimination against foreign
    companies in China. With respect to those, the biggest argument will be
    over an enforcement package, which the United States will insist China to
    give us the unilateral right to determine compliance and to act
    unilaterally if we deem it not to be occurring. The Chinese will argue for
    a consultative process or even arbitration, which are both non-starters for
    Ambassador Lighthizer. That issue, as well as the question of what to do
    about the existing tariffs, are likely to end up in the laps of the two
    presidents.


    Missing from this will be any unequivocal promises to turn away from a
    state-dominated economy—subsidies, support for SOEs, and implementation of
    “Made in China 2025”—and move in the direction of a real market economy
    rather than one that is just pretending. While doing that would make sense,
    the Chinese Communist Party's primary goal has always been maintaining
    control, and the past few years have made it abundantly clear that for Xi
    Jinping that includes continuing the government's heavy hand in directing
    the economy. There is a potential risk to him of pursuing that
    policy—slowing growth and the increased grumbling both within the party and
    the public that goes along with it—that may, in the long run, prove greater
    than the risk to party control that comes with shifting to a market
    economy; but that is their dilemma, not ours.


    How this works out poses risks for President Trump as well, both short term
    and long term. In the short term, the biggest risk is a breakdown or a
    failure to produce a deal that will cause the markets to sag and renew
    fears of a trade war. Most analysts believe he will go to great lengths to
    avoid that. Conversely, an agreement would certainly cause a market bump
    and pacify a very anxious business community and agriculture sector. But
    that also contains significant long-term risks.


    There is one clear path to lasting success for the president here—a good
    agreement that the Chinese actually comply with—but both those conditions
    are shaky. If the agreement is only about buying more stuff with a few
    intellectual property (IP) concessions thrown in, it will be heavily
    criticized, particularly by Democrats, as both a policy failure and a
    failure of the president's self-proclaimed negotiating skills. Even if it
    is better than that, the likelihood of full Chinese compliance is low. So,
    what might look like, and will certainly be touted as, a great success when
    it occurs may not look so great a year later if it becomes clear that very
    little has changed, or the United States has restarted the trade war with
    new tariffs due to Chinese non-compliance. The president, who does not have
    a history of looking ahead to the possible consequences of his actions,
    should do so very carefully in this case, as the negative outcome that is
    possible next year will be a lot closer to the election than the success of
    an agreement this March.
