        India's Inter-State Water Wars: Causes, Consequences, and Cures
      Monday, February 11, 2019 10:00 am - 11:30 amCSIS Headquarters  The Wadhwani Chair in U.S.-India Policy Studies at CSIS is pleased to invite you to a discussion on ‘India's Inter-State Water Wars: Causes, Consequences, and Cures,’ a topic covered in a new book of Subnational Hydropolitics: Conflict, Cooperation, and Institution-Building in Shared River Basins by Dr. Scott Moore, who serves as Senior Fellow at the Penn Water Center, Director of China Programs in the Office of the Provost, and Senior Fellow at the University of Pennsylvania Kleinman Center for Energy Policy and The Water Center at Penn.
From the San Francisco Bay area to Sao Paulo to Riyadh, water shortages increasingly cloud economic forecasts. But nowhere is the risk greater than in South Asia, where India, the largest economy and most important regional power, faces crippling shortages and a lack of consensus on what to do about them. In turn, water problems threaten to drag down India’s economic growth and slow its rise to regional power. In this talk, Scott Moore will draw on his recent book, Subnational Hydropolitics: Conflict, Cooperation, and Institution-Building in Shared River Basins, to explore some of the causes of India’s many inter-state water disputes, and what they say about the state of India’s federal system. He'll also discuss some promising ways to convert India’s pervasive sub-national water wars into cooperation.

This event is made possible through general support to CSIS.
