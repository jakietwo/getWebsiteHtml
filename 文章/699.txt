        The Evening: Saudi Arabia, North Korea, Refugee and More
October 15, 2018Good Evening,

It's Monday, October 15th.

Saudi Arabia

CNN’s Clarissa Ward and Tim Lister  report  late this afternoon that Saudi Arabia is preparing a report that will acknowledge that Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi's death was the result of an interrogation that went wrong, one that was intended to lead to his abduction from Turkey.

But earlier in the day, President Trump said King Salman of Saudi Arabia denied any knowledge during a 20-minute phone call on Monday about what happened to the journalist, Jamal Khashoggi and Trump raised the possibility that “rogue killers” were behind the disappearance. The President said he ordered Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to go to Saudi Arabia and “other places if necessary,” including Turkey, as the New York Times’ Eileen Sullivan and David D. Kirkpatrick  report.

Yemen on Brink of Famine

The number of Yemenis on the brink of famine could rise to 12 million - or two in five of the population - from around 8.5 million in coming months due to escalating war and a deepening economic crisis, the United Nations food agency said today, as Reuters  reports.

North and South Korea Connect

North and South Korea continued their push for peace today with high-level talks that resulted in a host of agreements, including a plan by the rivals for a groundbreaking ceremony this year on an ambitious project to connect their railways and roads, as the AP  reports.

Plus,  last night on 60 Minutes, President Trump discussed his relationship with Kim Jong Un.

Certain songs are so ubiquitous that I can barely recall life without them. Last night I watched the first episode of “The Romanoffs,” an elegant, quirky show on Amazon Prime. The opening title song was “Refugee” by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. I didn’t expect that at all. And it got me thinking about what a monumental, life changing song “Refugee” is.

When it came out in the fall of 1979, “Refugee” changed the way records sounded. I can’t recall the first time I heard the song but I do remember that it sounded like nothing I had ever heard before.

Here’s Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers performing “Refugee” in late 1978 at San Francisco’s Winterland, when it was brand new.
