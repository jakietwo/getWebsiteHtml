Semiconductors and microelectronics are the backbone of the digital economy and closely linked to national security. Recognizing this, China intends to gain semiconductor independence through espionage and immense investments, but it lags behind the U.S. If China achieves a dominant position in semiconductors it will likely use it for intelligence, military, commercial, and political advantage. At this event, we will discuss potential policy responses the U.S. can take to strengthen the position of American semiconductor companies and prevent the potential damaging effects of China's behavior.
