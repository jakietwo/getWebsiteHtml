By 2040 there will be 400 million Chinese elders—which is more than the total current population of France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the UK combined. The vast majority are due to reach old age without a pension or health-care coverage. How China navigates its aging challenge will go a long way toward determining whether it achieves its aspiration of becoming a prosperous and stable developed economy.
 
In Preparing for China's Aging Challenge, you will hear authorities from Carla Hills to Henry Kissinger explain how demography is about to transform China and its role in the world order. The video was originally shown at a joint CSIS and Chinese Academy of Social Sciences conference in Beijing in April 2004. The conference also showcased The Graying of the Middle Kingdom, a major new CSIS report on China's aging challenge.
