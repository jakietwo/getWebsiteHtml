March 6, 2019NK Rebuilding Long Range Rocket Site
President Trump today said he’d be very disappointed in Kim Jong Un if the CSIS Beyond Parallel reports are accurate that North Korea has begun rebuilding a missile test site it dismantled last year, as Bloomberg’s Jennifer Jacobs and Shannon Perry piece  report.

NBC's Andrea Mitchell first  reported on the CSIS analysis of commercially available satellite imagery last night.

Iranian Hackers
Cyberattacks linked to Iranian hackers have targeted thousands of people at more than 200 companies over the past two years, Microsoft said today, as the WSJ’s Robert McMillan  reports.


U.S. Trade Deficit
America’s trade deficit with the rest of the world rose to its highest level in history last year as the United States imported more goods than ever, including a record amount from China, ballooning the deficit to $891.3 billion and delivering a setback to President Trump’s goal of narrowing that gap, as the NYT’s Jim Tankersley and Ana Swanson  report.

Have you seen the third season of “True Detective” which just completed on HBO? I loved it—not as much as the first season with McConaughey and Harrelson, but it was still really good. Mahershala Ali and Stephen Dorff were excellent. The haunting opening theme song by Cassandra Wilson, a cover of Son House’s “Death Letter” is really serious too.
