ISIS Fighters in Captivity
 U.S.-backed forces in Syria are holding more than 2,000 suspected Islamic State fighters, doubling previous estimates. The new estimate will make it more difficult for the U.S. and its allies to wind down operations in Syria, as the WSJ’s Nancy Youssef and Gordon Lubold  report.

INF Aftermath
 Army Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday that the U.S. does not have a plan to stop Russia from building nuclear-capable intermediate-range missiles once the INF Treaty expires in five months. Scaparrotti suggested that the United States should revive or create a new treaty with Russia to set limits and create stability, as the Washington Post’s Paul Sonne  reports.

 “Reuben walked the streets of New Orleans till dawn/ Cerise so lightly in his arms and her hair hung gently down…”
 Today is Fat Tuesday—I smiled today when I received a widely distributed note from the president of my alma mater wishing all Tulanians a Happy Mardi Gras. I’m fascinated by the culture of organizatioU.S.-backed forces ns and my university certainly has a distinct one. 
 To be sure Mardi Gras has its decadent, and indeed seedy iterations. But the Mardi Gras I know and love is the one that is full of joyful music and people celebrating their love for the city. I’d like to think that Robert Hunter and Jerry Garcia captured a bit of that romanticism in the song “Reuben and Cerise.”
