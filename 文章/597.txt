        China Announces Sweeping Reform Agenda at Plenum
November 15, 2013The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) on November 12 concluded  the much anticipated Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee. Based on the  vague official communique released at the plenum’s closing, most initial media  commentary quickly pronounced the meeting disappointing—if not a total  failure—causing markets to punish Chinese stocks. But the new leadership team  proved these judgments to be premature with the release on November 15 of a  comprehensive blueprint containing the most sweeping reform proposals in  decades. The bold reform package is a powerful demonstration of President Xi  Jinping’s personal authority within the system after only a year at the helm of  the CCP.

 Q1:  Why was the initial press read of the plenum so far off?

A1: The miscue essentially reflects a poor understanding of the basic mechanics of  CCP procedure and practice. As a general rule, plenums are not heavy on  specifics. They usually set broad guidelines that, depending on the plenum’s  particular focus, are then translated into more defined policy outcomes at a  series of closed-door end-of-the-year meetings tasked with designing  implementation. The media criticisms were based on the lack of detail contained  in the plenum’s official communique, but the function of the communique is to  describe in lofty terms the plenum’s achievements, not to provide explicit recommendations.  Instead, the plenum’s “decision” or resolution, which trails the communique by  several days when made public, usually contains more granular directives. This  document often is kept secret, but, given this plenum's significance as the Xi  administration’s first major policy conclave, the leadership clearly wanted to  make a statement.

Q2:  What are the major reform recommendations contained in the “decision” document?

A2: Politburo Standing Committee member Yu Zhengsheng put it well late last month  when he hinted that “The depth and strength of the reforms will be  unprecedented and will promote profound changes in every area of the economy  and society.” The document directs an immediate end or substantial reform to  many of the regime’s most noxious—and longstanding—practices. It abolishes in  one stroke the labor camp system, promises a “step by step” reduction in the  number of crimes subject to the death penalty, and eases the one-child policy  by allowing couples to have two children if just one of them  is an only child, as opposed to the current stipulation that both parents must  be. Other important social reforms include establishing “reasonable  requirements” for rural residents to obtain hukou,  or residency permits, in large cities, and to create a path for rural migrants  to have access to affordable housing and social services in the cities where  they reside.

The document reaffirms the dominant role of the  public sector in the economy but upgrades the market to a “decisive” role in allocating  resources, in contrast to the previous characterization of the market’s role as  “basic.” Financial sector liberalization is a central focus of the reform  package. It allows for private capital to set up small- and medium-sized banks,  calls for the establishment of a deposit insurance system, and urges the  acceleration of market-based interest rates and the convertibility of the renminbi  capital account. Promoting a sense of urgency, central media immediately  featured the heads of the various financial regulatory agencies commenting on  the implications of the reforms for their respective industries.

Even the mighty vested interests in the state-owned  enterprises (SOEs) did not escape the reform tidal wave. The document announced  that thirty percent of SOE profits would be remitted to the central government  by 2020, up from the current zero-to-fifteen percent. Private firms also will  be allowed to enter some of the protected sectors—such as railways—and they are  encouraged to take part in reforming the state-owned firms. The document also  calls for professionalizing the management of the SOEs and for separating their  business functions from government.

In keeping with Xi’s anti-corruption drive, the  document also stressed reforms to the CCP’s anti-graft watchdog that include making  its officials less susceptible to interference from local officials in their  investigations. It calls for a more consultative policymaking process,  emphasizing new oversight responsibilities for the rubberstamp legislature and  additional checks on CCP power. The Chinese military also will undergo  potentially sweeping structural reform, with a proposed shift to a joint  command system and the establishment of operational theater commands that may  ultimately replace the current seven military regions.

Q3:  What about the two new leadership groups established at the plenum?

A3: The plenum also called for the launch of two new high-level leadership bodies  to improve policy coordination and implementation. On the economic side, the  CCP leading group for “comprehensively deepening reform” is expected to be  chaired by either President Xi or Premier Li Keqiang and to be staffed by  several other senior Politburo members. It will have an extraordinarily broad  writ and be tasked with managing the entire reform process from policy  formulation to design and through to implementation. A key challenge going  forward will be clearly defining the structural relationship between this  entity and the policy executing agencies tasked with carrying out its  directives.

Similarly, the document called for the creation of a  national security coordinating mechanism notionally modeled on the U.S.  National Security Council (NSC). Unlike the U.S. NSC, however, the Chinese  entity likely will have a strong focus on internal security matters. The  reference to its creation in the document was mentioned in the section  concerning the regime’s social management policies, and the Chinese foreign  ministry spokesman was quick to underscore that the body would be aimed at  dealing with “terrorists, extremists, and separatists.” 

Still, there may well be some internal confusion—or  perhaps friction—over the body’s jurisdiction. Of note, official media  initially translated the body’s name into English as the “State Security  Committee,” using the regime’s code language typically associated with internal  security matters. In citations following the release of the full plenum  document, however, the English rendering now refers to a “National Security  Commission” and states explicitly that the body will deal with both internal  and external security matters. As of this writing, the nomenclature discrepancy  has not been rationalized on the official news agency’s English-language website,  which is unusual.

Q4:  What does this all say about Xi Jinping’s standing in the system?

A4: The decisive plenum outcome underscores that Xi has fully consolidated power  and is rapidly emerging as the most powerful Chinese leader in more than a  decade. The establishment of the National Security Commission—a goal that eluded  his two predecessors—shows he has tamed the most powerful elements in the party  machinery, the military, and the intelligence and security services, all of whom  will lose at least some policy autonomy under this new framework. Other reforms  hinted at in the “decision”—such as the mooted military structural changes and  the modifications to the anti-graft system—also reflect longstanding debates  within the system that never were resolved due to substantial bureaucratic  resistance and infighting. Moreover, both of the new leadership bodies  demonstrate that Xi has sufficient clout to create structural solutions at the  highest levels of the system to get around ministerial-or organizational-level  foot-dragging. We should now watch closely to see if Xi staffs these new bodies  with his close associates as yet another demonstration of his growing power.
