Cabo Verde navigates a complex array of foreign partnerships, balancing the interests of great powers like China, the U.S. and the EU. Chinese construction and financial assistance, predating now-widespread China-Africa engagement, was instrumental to the island nation’s development. At the same time, the African country also has a rich history of trade and bilateral migration with the U.S., and has signed a special partnership agreement with the EU. As its foreign partners vie for influence across Africa, questions surface regarding Cabo Verde’s longstanding and conflicting diplomatic ties.
 
The CSIS Africa Program and The Wilson Center invite you to a conversation with Prime Minister José Ulisses de Pina Correia e Silva on Monday, March 25, from 12:30-2:00 pm.  Judd Devermont (CSIS Africa Program) will join the Prime Minister to discuss Cabo Verde’s bilateral relations, particularly with China, and how the U.S. can support the country’s interests.
 
His Excellency José Ulisses de Pina Correia e Silva is the fifth Prime Minister of the Republic of Cabo Verde and is also President of Movement for Democracy (MPD), the country’s majority party. Since becoming the head of government in April 2016, Prime Minister Correia e Silva has led Cabo Verde along the path of sustained economic growth and critical political reform. Early domestic indicators of success include: Significant surges in GDP growth with corresponding reductions in public debt; a rapid influx of foreign direct investment and tourism activity; declining unemployment rates; and expanded educational and entrepreneurial opportunities for citizens. The Prime Minister has also championed a pragmatic, regional approach to problem-solving and forged unprecedented partnerships with municipal leaders.

Internationally, Prime Minister Correia e Silva has been instrumental in building Cabo Verde’s reputation as the historic crossroads between Africa, the Americas, and Europe while simultaneously strengthening its emerging strategic value for transatlantic collaboration.

Prior to becoming Prime Minister, Mr. Correia e Silva was the Mayor of Praia, Cabo’s Verde largest city and capital. During his two terms and eight years in office, Praia experienced an economic and cultural renaissance, ultimately leading to his reception of the 2015 African Mayor Award.

This event is made possible through general support to CSIS.
