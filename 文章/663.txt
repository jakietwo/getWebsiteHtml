        The Afghan War of Attrition: Peace Talks Remain an Extension of War by Other Means
By Anthony H. CordesmanJuly 16, 2018
    If the U.S. has any real strategy in Afghanistan, it seems to be fighting a
    war of attrition long enough and well enough for the threat to drop to a
    level that Afghan forces can handle or accept a peace settlement credible
    enough for the U.S. to leave. After seventeen years of combat, no one at
    any level is claiming that enough military progress has been made in
    strengthening the ANSF enough for it to win. The most favorable claims seem
    to be that the ANSF are not losing, may someday become able to win with
    U.S. support.


    No one is making any serious claims about success at the civil level in
    terms of politics, governance, and economics. Hope for the civil side seems
    to rely on the theory that if you attempt enough reform plans, one may
    eventually work. This is a literal triumph of hope over experience.


    Even with direct costs that now seem likely to exceed one trillion dollars,
    more than 2,200 dead, and more than 20,000 wounded in action, the U.S.
    commitment is as open ended as ever. The U.S. is still appealing to its
    allies for aid and troops, and there is no agreement over whether enemy
    progress is expanding the area where it has control or disputes control
    with the Afghan government remains a subject of debate.


    
        Limited Progress in Shaping the Afghan Forces is Not Enough
    


    The U.S. and allies do seem to have made real progress in improving Afghan
    security forces, even if no one can yet predict when they can stand on
    their own – or will need less money, fewer advisors on the ground, and less
    air support. A sharp increase in U.S. combat air support, sending advisors
    forward to the Afghan equivalent of the battalion level, expanding the
    number of elite Afghan counterinsurgency forces, and creating more
    specialized and effective U.S. advisors and trainers have all had a
    positive impact. It has also sharply limited U.S. casualties and costs.


    The problem is that this level of military progress has yet to show that it
    can guarantee that Afghan forces can hold every major population center,
    much less defeat the Taliban and other threats. It is unclear that most
    Afghans feel more secure, or that the Taliban and other threat forces are
    becoming discouraged enough to quit. The U.S. has taken a harder line
    toward Pakistan, but it is unclear that this has had any serious impact.
    Iran and Russia now seem more willing to work with the Taliban, and the
    continuing Taliban and ISIS attacks even in major Afghan cities do seem to
    be further undermining Afghan popular confidence in their security.


    
        Losing the War by "Winning" the Peace: Afghanistan vs. Vietnam
    


    There are deeply disturbing parallels between the current situation in
    Afghanistan and the time in Vietnam when the U.S. seemed to be "winning" by
    creating South Vietnamese that could enforce the "peace" the U.S.
    negotiated with North Vietnam after the Tet offensive, a massive bombing
    campaign, and years of "peace" negotiations. The North Vietnamese
    understood that they could keep fighting and win once the U.S. left. Some
    of the U.S. policymakers involved in the negotiations did fully understand
    the risks, but a majority probably did not. They thought they had won a war
    by agreeing to terms that lost it.


    For all the differences between the wars of attrition in Afghanistan and
    Vietnam, there are other grim parallels. The U.S. underestimated the
    outside support North Vietnam would continue to receive. It sharply
    overestimated how well the South Vietnamese forces could hold on. There was
    a near denial of how badly divided the Vietnamese government was, how
    corrupt and ineffective the government was at both the civil and military
    levels, the level of economic strain on the country and government, and how
    ineffective the shell of a democracy was in actually motivating and uniting
    the people.


    The Civil Side is Much Worse Off than the Military


    Just as there are many competent, honest, and patriotic Afghans in both the
    civil government and the security forces, there were many similar
    Vietnamese. But, the overall structure of politics and governance was
    deeply divided and corrupt, the economy favored a narrow part of the total
    population, and far too many Vietnamese had divided loyalties. The military
    side of the war had serious problems, but the failures on the civil side
    were far deeper.


    This lack of civil progress in Afghanistan gets only limited attention, but
    may actually be as more serious challenge than the military one. The U.S.
    at least has the shell of a strategy on the military side. Rhetoric about
    "conditionality" on the civil side, and the economic failures of a deeply
    divided civil government, seems to be just that: hollow words glossing over
    negligible real-world progress.


    Unlike Afghanistan, the South Vietnamese government at least had the shell
    of unity, there were no major warlords, and the divisions between groups
    like South Vietnam's Buddhists and Catholics were limited compared to
    Afghanistan's sectarian, ethnics and tribal differences. If one compares
    the mess that the Afghan central government has become, the impact of
    Afghan flight to major cities to seek security and jobs, and World Bank and
    IMF warnings about the Afghan narco-economy; the civil side of Afghanistan
    is far worse than Vietnam was before its collapse.


    Peace Negotiations as the Extension of War by Other Means


    And, this brings up two other case studies that are a warning about the
    current situation in Afghanistan, and the growing U.S. effort to "win" a
    war of attrition by negotiating with the Taliban. Like Vietnam, the civil
    wars in Cambodia and Nepal are scarcely copies of the situation in
    Afghanistan. Both, however, are case examples where the rebels used peace
    negotiations and a role in government to win a war they could not win on
    the battlefield.


    Today's Cambodian government – and its increasingly authoritarian
    dominating political party – are to some extent the postwar result of
    successful political manipulations by the kinder and gentler parts of the
    Pol Pot regime. As for Nepal, a much smaller cadre of Maoists insurgents
    were able to manipulate the peace to become a leading faction. If war is
    sometime said to be an "extension of diplomacy by other means," both cases
    warn that peace negotiations are equally often an extension of war by other
    means.


    "The Only Way to Win is Not to Play"


    This raises a set of dilemmas that no one in U.S. politics may wish to
    openly address, but that the U.S. will still have to live with. The only
    way to quickly end the U.S. role in Afghanistan may be the equivalent of
    declaring victory and leaving: reaching a peace settlement with the Taliban
    that is far more likely to succeed than fail.


    The alternatives are to let the war drag on and on in something close to
    its current form hoping that the Taliban will give up first. Or, to fund a
    far larger U.S. effort that both steps up the level of military support and
    that forces the civil side of the Afghan government to be far more united,
    honest, and effective.


    None of these options are particularly attractive in terms of domestic U.S.
    politics, but a certain amount of honesty is needed even in war. Declaring
    peace and leaving is likely to be no different than declaring victory and
    leaving. About all that can be said for such a choice is that the world has
    already more or less accepted the fact the U.S. may not win in Afghanistan.
    Moreover, one way to win this new "great game in Asia may be to stop
    playing. It will be Russia, Iran, Pakistan, China, and the Central Asian
    states" that inherit the resulting mess. It is hard to see how they will be
    any less likely to lose by "winning."
