 Also, see “Poor Iranians bear brunt of sanctions as food prices soar,” by the FT’s Najmeh Bozorgmehr and Monavar Khalaj.

I experienced music this morning in a way I’ve never before. You see my wife Amy now has us wired at home with our very own Alexa.
 “Ask Alexa to play any song you want,” Amy said.
 “Okay,” I said, only half believing Alexa was going to deliver. “Alexa, play Dixie Chicken by Little Feat.”
 And Alexa did! Just like that. So I asked Alexa to play “Taxman,” by the Beatles. Then “Funky Miracle,” by the Meters and “Fiyo on the Bayou” by the Neville Brothers. Alexa didn’t miss a note! I quickly realized that just as we can walk the earth with an endless portable juke box in our pockets in the form of an iPhone, we can now ask our new buddy Alexa to play us just about any song we want to hear at home or in the office.
 I know that I’m by no means the first person to discover Alexa. In fact, one in six Americans now own a smart speaker and most of those people own an Amazon Alexa device.  I sure am glad that I’m now acquainted with Alexa!
