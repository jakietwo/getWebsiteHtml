        60 Minutes and Whiplash
November 6, 2018
    H. ANDREW SCHWARTZ: North Korea is the impossible state. It’s a place
    that’s stumped leaders and policymakers for more than three decades.


    (Begin recorded “60 Minutes” segment.)


    LESLEY STAHL (CBS News): Slave labor, public executions. This is a guy you
    love?


    PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I know all these things. I mean, I’m not a baby. I
    know all these things.


    MS. STAHL: I know, but why do you love that guy?


    PRESIDENT TRUMP: Look, I have – I like – I get along with him, OK? And I
    say –


    MS. STAHL: But you said love him.


    PRESIDENT TRUMP: That’s just a figure of speech.


    MS. STAHL: That’s like an – no, it’s like an embrace.


    PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, let it be an embrace. Let it be whatever it is to
    get the job done.


    MS. STAHL: Yeah, but he’s a bad guy.


    (End recorded “60 Minutes” segment.)


    MR. SCHWARTZ: It has a complex history. And it has become the United
    States’ top national security priority.


    SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO: (From recording.) While there’s still a
    long way to go and much work to do, we can now see a path to where we’ll
    achieve the ultimate goal, which is the full and final verified
    denuclearization of North Korea.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Each week on this show we’ll talk with the people who know
    the most about North Korea: CSIS’s Victor Cha, Mike Green, and Sue Mi
    Terry.


    In this episode of The Impossible State, CSIS’s Victor Cha and Sue Mi Terry
    discuss President Trump’s “60 Minutes” interview and we discuss what to
    expect at the next Trump-Kim Jong-un summit. Plus, the latest chapter in
    the new edition of this podcast’s namesake, Victor Cha’s seminal book “The
    Impossible State.”


    Victor and Sue, “The Impossible State” was first published in 2012, and it
    immediately became the must-read for all who were interested in
    developments on the Korean Peninsula. What’s new in this updated edition in
    2018? And why did you call – I kind of think I know, but why did you call
    the new chapter “Whiplash”?


    VICTOR CHA: (Laughs.) So the new chapter was called “Whiplash” because that
    chapter is about Trump more than it is about the situation in North Korea.
    I mean, in many ways I ended the – I ended the first edition talking about
    the uncertainties in the future regarding North Korea. But then it’s ironic
    that the main chapter that we write for the new book is about the
    uncertainties of U.S. policy given this very unpredictable president.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: We have changed. They haven’t really changed.


    MR. CHA: Yeah. I mean, they’ve pretty much been on a steady state with this
    leader consolidating power. When I wrote this book we were working on a
    nine-month timeline, and then North Korean leader Kim Jong-il died of a
    massive stroke and they said we need the book in two months. So it ended up
    being the first book to come out after the death of Kim Jong-il, but we
    were guessing about the future and talked about a lot of the uncertainties
    within North Korea. Little did we expect that five years later the biggest
    uncertainty would be the United States.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Now, this is one of those books on the list in North Korea.
    It’s like a no-no. You cannot bring this book into North Korea. Our friend
    Evan Osnos from The New Yorker famously left it in his suitcase and brought
    it in, and the first thing they took from him at the airport was Victor’s
    book, “The Impossible State,” the previous edition.


    Sue, I believe you were in government when this came out. Tell us what you
    think about the new chapter and why it’s so important now.


    SUE MI TERRY: Because it really brings it to just better understanding now
    of what’s happening with North Korea. I think Victor said North Korea
    actually has been consistent. Even though Kim Jong-un, there was a lot of
    uncertainty when Kim Jong-un came into power, now looking back there are
    still – North Korea have a strategy, Kim Jong-un has a strategy and a plan,
    and it’s really the unpredictable wild card here now is the Trump
    administration. So I think he really needed to sort of write this chapter
    and bring us up to date. And of course, this is a required reading for my
    class at Georgetown. It was a required reading for my class at Columbia.
    And there’s a reason why North Koreans don’t like it, because he tells the
    truth. And he has a unique position from –


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Victor tells the truth.


    MS. TERRY: Yeah, Victor tells the truth, of course.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Yeah.


    MS. TERRY: And he brings that policy background and academic and scholarly
    background in writing this book. So North Koreans don’t like it, but we
    like it here.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Victor, you intended it – and it is – it’s a mainstream book.
    This is the kind of book that, you know, is at the front of Amazon stores.
    This isn’t just a scholarly book. I mean, this is for people who really
    want to understand what the impossible state is.


    MR. CHA: Yeah. I mean, there’s no theory in this book. (Laughs.)


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Right.


    MR. CHA: It is really – it was pitched at a general audience, and I’m
    gratified that a lot of people have read it. I mean, I remember when
    Michael Kirby, who was doing the U.N. commission report on North Korea, met
    with me, and he said that the chapter that we wrote on human rights was one
    of the first things that he read with regard to human rights as he was
    thinking about the commission report.


    So, yeah, I’m gratified that a wide – you know, a wide swath of society has
    read it. That’s certainly the way it was pitched. It has a lot of my
    stories in it from when I was in – from when I was in government to try to
    give it a little bit more of a personal perspective. And so I’m really glad
    that this new edition has come out and tried to, you know, bring things up
    to date.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: So, speaking of up to date, President Trump last night –
    Sunday night – went on “60 Minutes,” and a big part of the interview was
    about Kim Jong-un. What did he say?


    MR. CHA: I mean, it was extraordinary. I mean, it was just an extraordinary
    interview.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: (Laughs.) That’s pretty –


    MR CHA: I mean, first of all, Leslie Stahl asked great questions. I mean,
    she really pushed him. And what I was really struck by was, first, you
    know, he reaffirmed his love for the North Korean leader. She asked him, do
    you still love him, and he said, yes, I do. (Laughs.)


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Which was pretty mind-blowing.


    MR. CHA: Yeah, yeah. That, and then he also reaffirmed that he actually
    trusted the North Korean leader. And, you know, Stahl challenged him on his
    human rights record and all these other things, and she just – you know, he
    insisted that he – that he trusted this leader. I was saying earlier the
    thing that really struck me about the interview is when you actually watch
    the interview they did a very close-shot frame of the president as he was
    speaking about North Korea, and you look at his eyes as he’s speaking – you
    just look in – and I looked very carefully, and I really sensed either he’s
    got ice water in his veins or he truly believes what he’s saying.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Maybe a little of both. (Laughs.)


    MR. CHA: Yeah. But I really sense that he truly believes what he’s saying;
    I mean, that he really does believe that he trusts the North Korean leader
    and that he can do this differently and that he can get to a solution. I
    mean, it was really extraordinary.


    MS. TERRY: Well, I think, you know, maybe he – maybe he’s in love with Kim
    Jong-un over the exchange of the most “beautiful letters” that he has ever
    read.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: They were very “beautiful letters.”


    MS. TERRY: But I think, you know, whether he is truly enamored by Kim or
    not – and I think, you know, maybe Kim is an affable guy. President Moon
    Jae-in seems to like him. Maybe there is something about him that’s
    likeable in person. But I think another point that I wanted to make is that
    this kind of shows President Trump’s extreme transactional approach to the
    presidency. It’s almost like if there’s no meaning to, like, what’s good or
    bad. So even when you look at some other questions that he was answering,
    for example on Christine Blasey Ford, Dr. Ford’s testimony, he was
    attacking her, but then he justified it by saying he won. So that kind of
    gave me this idea, maybe he’s like this is his way of kowtowing to Kim
    Jong-un is sort of, you know, maybe he thinks this is a way to sort of get
    a better deal out of Kim. So maybe it is both, as you just mentioned.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: It doesn’t matter what he says now –


    MS. TERRY: Yeah.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: – but if in the end he wins, the United States, everybody
    wins.


    MS. TERRY: Right. Right, because I was really struck by that, like, I won,
    right? So maybe he thinks if he wins this way, by really flattering Kim,
    that justifies it.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: And clearly, we’d all like to win on North Korea.


    Victor, do you have any recommendations for the Trump administration in its
    overall approach to North Korea that you put in “Whiplash,” in the chapter?


    MR. CHA: Yeah. I mean, I think – well, certainly to keep the – keep our eye
    on the ball, which is, you know, sort of a true denuclearization. I mean,
    we’re in this because we’re trying to eliminate the nuclear threat in North
    Korea. And so keeping our eye on the ball – I mean, the North Koreans are
    throwing all sorts of other distractions out there, and the South Koreans
    are, you know, somewhat complicit in trying to move this – keep the
    diplomatic momentum going. But that’s one thing, is we got to really keep
    it on verifiable denuclearization.


    The other is that, you know, I think, as Sue said, all Trump cares about is
    winning. And then the question is always – what happens in every one of
    these interactions between Americans and North Koreans at these very high
    levels is the Americans come out and they list all the things that the
    North Koreans are willing to do, but they don’t really talk about what
    we’re going to give for those things. And so the second major sort of
    recommendation is let’s not give away too much for too little.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Right.


    MR. CHA: Right? I mean, the last thing we want is to be giving away
    equities in our alliance relationships – the exercising, troops, all this
    stuff – for a bad deal on nuclear weapons that for experts would be
    unacceptable; but for the politicians, they may have a much lower bar for
    what is acceptable in terms of saying that they’ve dealt with this threat.
    So that would be my second one, is, like, let’s not get a bad deal.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Well, let’s talk about that for a minute. Sue, are we on the
    path towards a bad deal, an unenforceable deal, a deal that we could – that
    would be untenable to experts in the United States?


    MS. TERRY: Well, unfortunately, I just think there’s a lot of dysfunction
    and chaos and lack of policy coordination within the Trump administration.
    We have, oftentimes, President Trump undermining his own officials. So, for
    example, when Secretary Pompeo on September 19th said we need
    timeline, and he gave a timeline on what he wants to see in terms of
    denuclearization, then President Trump just a couple weeks later says, oh,
    no, we don’t want to play this time game, I don’t need to play this time
    game. So he kind of sort of undermined what Pompeo said.


    So I’m with Victor here in terms of not giving away too much and having our
    eye on the ball. My concern is that because there is a lack of
    coordination, because there is a lack of – it’s just mixed messages coming
    out of the administration. I’m not sure if we are on the right path here. I
    really think North Korea has a strategy. Kim Jong-un has a plan. South
    Korea has a strategy. President Moon Jae-in has a plan. I’m just not sure
    exactly if we are on the same page among the Trump administration officials
    and President Trump in terms of our strategy.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Well, they keep showing they’re on the same page. In fact,
    today the North and the South agreed to connect the two via roads and
    railroads, and that’s a pretty big development.


    MR. CHA: Yeah, it’s a big development. I mean, it is – it’s still not
    something that they can do without violating existing sanctions, the U.N. –
    their own sanctions, their May 24th sanctions, the U.N.
    sanctions regime, and U.S. sanctions on North Korea. So, you know, I think
    they are pushing as close to the edge as they can get in terms of trying to
    get the United States to be more flexible on sanctions.


    When they did their third – when the two Korean leaders did their third
    summit, I was in Seoul that week for CSIS. And just watching all of this,
    the thing that came out of that was a whole list of these economic
    cooperation projects, which you just mentioned the railroads are one of
    them. And when I looked at that list, all that said to me was the U.S., you
    have to lift sanctions. I mean, it’s putting pressure on the United States
    to lift sanctions, again, before we’ve gotten anything really significant
    on denuclearization. So this is – you know, that’s how you start to get the
    makings of a bad deal.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Well, some would say we’ve already given them too much.


    MR. CHA: Yeah, I think some – particularly on the exercising, I think
    people – there were a number of people after the Singapore summit who felt
    that the president’s unilaterally giving up exercising was a dangerous step
    because that’s how we keep the alliance strong, is through exercising. And
    it’s not clear if he’s going to continue to call for suspension of major
    exercises, which are to be sometime next February.


    MS. TERRY: Well, I think we’re also poised to, in a way, give away more, if
    you will, because it looks like there is going to be second summit between
    Trump and Kim, and there is a lot of pressure to – for the U.S. to give
    this end of war declaration, peace declaration. There’s a lot of pressure
    from South Korea. Obviously, North Koreans are pressing it, China, Russia.
    It’s really all of them are against – you know, they’re pressing the United
    States, and I think we might give away even that peace declaration. I think
    that’s the next step.


    MR. CHA: You know, we always end up in this position, the Americans. I once
    described it as the dilemma of American reasonableness – (laughter) –


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Right.


    MR. CHA: – because what happens is, you know, everybody’s so excited to get
    North Korea to the table, right – the Russians, the South Koreans, the
    Chinese are all excited to get the North Koreans at the table – and then,
    you know, the North Koreans, you know, we want 100 from them and they give
    maybe 15, right – you know, 15 out of 100. And by any objective standards,
    that’s not acceptable. But the surrounding parties – the South Koreans, the
    Chinese, and the Russians – all look at the – you know, what the North
    Koreans, they’ve given, and they go, well, you know, it’s better than
    nothing. And if we get –


    MR. SCHWARTZ: At least they came to the table.


    MR. CHA: At least they came to the table. If we stop here, then we don’t –
    we’re not at the table anymore. So who are we going to try to convince? Are
    we going to try to convince the North Koreans to give more or are we going
    to try to convince the Americans to take less? And invariably, they always
    come to the Americans to take less, because we’re always – relatively
    speaking, we’re a much more reasonable party than the North Koreans are.
    (Laughs.) So this is – this is what always happens. And, like, that
    constellation is starting to come into formation right now.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: What kind of leverage do we have if we’re – if we continue to
    give away our leverage?


    MR. CHA: If we’re going to do a second summit, what it requires is for the
    president to set the bar high in terms of what we’re going to get if we’re
    going to give a second summit. I mean, a meeting with a president of the
    United States is not like a meeting with any other leader in the world,
    especially for North Korea. Because he can meet three times with Xi
    Jinping, he can meet with Putin, he can meet with Moon. The one he really
    wants to meet is the American president. So we should leverage that. I
    mean, we –


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Yeah.


    MS. TERRY: Yeah, the problem is President Trump wants to meet with Kim
    Jong-un. So we’ve always given away.


    MR. CHA: Yeah. Well, that’s the problem.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Well, he loves them. They’re friends.


    MS. TERRY: Yeah. And they said, there’s going to be a second summit
    regardless very, very soon. So we’re really giving away that leverage. And
    if we’re going to give away a peace declaration too, we need to make sure
    we get something out of that. But already South Koreans are sort of saying,
    well, let’s step away from declaration for declaration. Remember when that
    was a proposal, that we’re going to at least get a declaration from North
    Korea of all their nuclear missile inventory and facilities and program?
    But we’re now even talking about not doing that. South Koreans have floated
    this proposal for declaration for disablement of Yongbyon facility. So I
    just think we need to think very hard about if this summit is going to
    happen – and I think it will – exactly what Victor said. Like, what are we
    going to get for peace declaration?


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Let’s talk about the potential second summit. It’s pretty
    clear it’s going to happen. You both think it’s going to happen. When is it
    going to happen? It’s not going to happen before the midterms, right?


    MR. CHA: Yeah, there’s probably not enough time before the midterms. I
    don’t know what you think, Sue.


    MS. TERRY: I don’t think there’s enough time. Trump is going to Paris on
    November 11th to attend – it’s a celebration of the end of World
    War I. And then there’s G-20 in November – end of November, between
    November 30th and December 1st. So if he’s going to
    those two events, he’s certainly not – certainly not leaving, again, the
    country in mid-November, unless he has a stopover when he goes to Paris,
    maybe in Switzerland or Sweden. That’s the earliest he could possibly do
    it. But, again, I think we’re running out of time. Again, of course, unless
    Kim Jong-un comes to Washington or Mar-a-Lago or –


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Is that a real possibility? Is that –


    MR. CHA: Oh, I think – maybe not the second summit – but I think Trump
    wants to host Kim Jong-un at Mar-a-Lago. That would be – you know, that
    would be the biggest event.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: At Mar-a-Lago?


    MR. CHA: Yeah, at Mar-a-Lago. That would be the biggest television
    spectacle that you can imagine. You know, I mean, he would love that.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Talk about made for TV.


    MR. CHA: Made for TV. He would absolutely love that.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: And it would enshrine Mar-a-Lago, of course, as, you know,
    diplomatic ground zero.


    MR. CHA: Right. Right, exactly. And he’s hosted all the other major Asian
    leaders there. He’s hosted Abe there, the prime minister of Japan.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Yeah, the famous golden golf club.


    MR. CHA: Yeah, the golden golf club. (Laughs.) He’s hosted Xi Jinping
    there. It was their first meeting where –


    MS. TERRY: Had beautiful chocolate cake together.


    MR. CHA: Beautiful chocolate – his granddaughter sung a Chinese song.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Yeah.


    MR. CHA: For Xi. You know, so he – you know, I think he really feels like
    he likes to host the Asian leaders there. And this would be, like, the
    ultimate for him, I think – just the ultimate.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Oh, boy. Well, we’ll have to wait and see, I guess. And
    that’s what the president always says. He says: Well, we’ll wait and see. I
    think you all have made pretty clear that some of the stuff that they’ve
    done has been constructive.


    MR. CHA: Sure. Yeah, absolutely. And I think the idea of holding out a
    second summit now and allowing Pompeo and Biegun to start working-level
    negotiations –


    MR. SCHWARTZ: This is Steve Biegun, the – yeah, the representative.


    MR. CHA: Steve Biegun, the special representative, senior envoy for North
    Korea, who is essentially Pompeo’s right-hand man.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Yeah.


    MR. CHA: So if Pompeo is Trump’s right-hand man on North Korea, then Biegun
    is Pompeo’s right-hand man on North Korea.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Got it.


    MR. CHA: I mean, we’re now set up now with, you know, Biegun doing
    working-level meetings, Pompeo doing meetings, all for the purpose of a
    second summit. That’s now starting to look like a more normal negotiating
    process. That’s the way you’re supposed to do it, not the way that happened
    this past summer where we did the summit first without any agreements that
    were made in advance. So that’s a positive thing, I think. And then the
    other positive thing is at least when Pompeo came back from his trip to
    south Korea he said that the North Koreans might be interested in allowing
    outside inspectors in to inspect the decommissioning of the nuclear test
    site, which they blew up the tunnels for a bunch of journalists in the
    summer.


    I mean, that’s good in the sense that it’s starting to establish a norm of
    outside verification of whatever North Korea does on its weapons programs.
    And that’s something that they hadn’t agreed to in the past. So those are
    positive things. But these are still small steps. They’re not the – like we
    said, you have to keep your eye on the ball. The main thing is, you know,
    the declaration, a comprehensive declaration, verification and a timeline
    of dismantlement. And those three things have not been scratched yet.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: And for our part, we’re still trying to exert leverage. I
    mean, last week Jonathan Cheng of The Wall Street Journal reported that
    U.S. officials are preventing American aid workers from making humanitarian
    trips to North Korea. What about that?


    MR. CHA: I mean, I think that’s really unfortunate. These humanitarian aid
    groups are largely – they’re working on public health issues. There’s a
    drug resistant strain of tuberculosis in the country. And that’s very
    serious. I mean, if those people migrate to China, you know, this could be
    a disaster. So, and usually they’re always – there has always been in
    existing U.N. sanctions a humanitarian carve out. But it appears as though
    there has been this blanket refusal recently of all these visas for
    humanitarian groups. And that’s – you know, that is – you know, whether
    that’s actually a bargaining chip presumes that the regime in North Korea
    cares about the public health of these people who are outside the elite.
    I’m not really sure they care. So I don’t know if that makes it a
    bargaining chip.


    MS. TERRY: No, I 100 percent agree. We shouldn’t be punishing the normal
    North Koreans. Hepatitis, tuberculosis which is highest, I think, in the
    world, malaria, all of this is totally endemic in North Korea. I think half
    of North Korea’s children suffer from malnutrition. There’s half of
    children living in rural areas don’t have drinking water. I mean, they have
    serious problems. And as Victor just pointed out, I don’t think the North
    Korean regime would at least really care. They can just go on without these
    people. So they don’t care about the suffering of these people.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: So this isn’t real leverage. Stopping this isn’t real
    leverage.


    MS. TERRY: No, it’s not. I don’t think so.


    MR. CHA: I don’t think so. I don’t think it’s real leverage. And I don’t
    really know the full story behind it, and I don’t think even in Jonathan
    Cheng’s Wall Street Journal piece –


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Right. It was unclear why they did this.


    MR. CHA: It’s not clear why they did this, yeah. So I don’t think we have a
    full picture of what is actually driving this. But it is certainly a change
    in the policy from what we’ve seen in the past that has a real impact on
    the welfare of the average North Korean. Not the elite, but the average –
    the average North Korean.


    Just to cross-plug another CSIS product, you know, Steve Morrison in our
    Global Health Security Program has just put together this fantastic video
    on the public health situation in North Korea that really addresses some of
    these questions about the things Sue talked about – TB, malaria, and all
    these other diseases because of malnutrition and lack of a public health
    infrastructure in the country.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: I mean, this is really an extraordinary moment, though, when
    you’ve got the president of the United States continuing to profess his
    love for the North Korean leader. You have catastrophic things going on
    inside North Korea, like we just described. And now, U.S. aid workers not
    being able to go there. What do you think happens next? Do you think that
    there’s more back and forth between the U.S. and North Korea? Does – do the
    South Koreans help us step this up? What’s the plan here?


    MR. CHA: So I think the big enchilada now is this second summit. And is
    there going to be enough progress made on denuclearization for the United
    States to agree to a second summit? And from a South Korean perspective, is
    there going to be U.S. flexibility on lifting sanctions, so that the South
    can start to pursue their inter-Korean economic cooperation agenda? And
    then – and then the other question is, where is Putin going to fit into all
    this, right, because I think there is some questions of whether he will –
    Kim will meet Putin. And then, where does Japan fit in all this? Because
    they are – Japan is sort of the odd man out at this point.


    MS. TERRY: We know, first of all, Kim Jong-un had seven summits in five
    months, right? He met with Xi Jinping three times, Moon Jae-in three times,
    once with Trump. And then it looks like –


    MR. CHA: He’s busier than the U.N. secretary-general, right?


    MS. TERRY: I know. I know, he is. And then now he’s going to Russia. He
    will meet with Putin. Apparently Xi Jinping will come to Pyongyang. And
    then Kim Jong-un is supposed to go to South Korea, which is going to be
    huge – just the reception in South Korea. It’s just going to be just a big
    show. And now the Japanese have said they want to open a liaison office in
    Pyongyang to talk about abduction issues. So he is – Kim Jong-un is fully
    engaged in all of this summitry and diplomacy. And just my concern is I
    think we’re just going to meet with Kim Jong-un, again, President Trump
    will, in the second summit.


    And not only is sort of, you know, are we talking about sanctions, but I’m
    concerned that there’s going to be a peace declaration. And it’s not that
    I’m concerned about just giving a peace declaration. I just think that if
    there is going to be one, there needs to be something we get back from
    North Korea. And we should have a crystal-clear understanding – agreement
    on what that looks like in terms of definition, in terms of condition, in
    terms of intentions, because we saw in Singapore, with Singapore
    declaration, after there was a lot of confusion about the order, the
    sequencing, what we mean by denuclearization. So if there is going to be a
    peace declaration, we need to have a crystal-clear understanding by all
    parties.


    MR. CHA: Nobody’s against peace, right? Everybody’s for peace. But we know
    this is something that the North Koreans want. So we have to make sure we
    get what we want from that. And, you know, frankly, allowing a few
    inspectors into a test site that they’ve already cleaned out –


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Doesn’t cut it.


    MR. CHA: Doesn’t cut it. Promising to resell the five-megawatt reactor at
    Yongbyon, which has already been the subject of the last two agreements,
    you know, for this, you know, really paradigm-shifting agreement to some
    sort of peace declaration –


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Yeah, it’s like how many times can you trot out that old
    horse?


    MR. CHA: Right. Yeah, yeah. I mean, there was a famous saying that the
    Obama administration used. And I mean, Sue knows this well because she was
    in it, right? We’re not going to buy the same horse a third time.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Yeah.


    MS. TERRY: Secretary Gates said it.


    MR. CHA: Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, I mean, we look like we may be on that
    path again. And that would not be a positive outcome, I think, from a U.S.
    negotiating perspective.

        60 Minutes and Whiplash
November 6, 2018
    H. ANDREW SCHWARTZ: North Korea is the impossible state. It’s a place
    that’s stumped leaders and policymakers for more than three decades.


    (Begin recorded “60 Minutes” segment.)


    LESLEY STAHL (CBS News): Slave labor, public executions. This is a guy you
    love?


    PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I know all these things. I mean, I’m not a baby. I
    know all these things.


    MS. STAHL: I know, but why do you love that guy?


    PRESIDENT TRUMP: Look, I have – I like – I get along with him, OK? And I
    say –


    MS. STAHL: But you said love him.


    PRESIDENT TRUMP: That’s just a figure of speech.


    MS. STAHL: That’s like an – no, it’s like an embrace.


    PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, let it be an embrace. Let it be whatever it is to
    get the job done.


    MS. STAHL: Yeah, but he’s a bad guy.


    (End recorded “60 Minutes” segment.)


    MR. SCHWARTZ: It has a complex history. And it has become the United
    States’ top national security priority.


    SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO: (From recording.) While there’s still a
    long way to go and much work to do, we can now see a path to where we’ll
    achieve the ultimate goal, which is the full and final verified
    denuclearization of North Korea.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Each week on this show we’ll talk with the people who know
    the most about North Korea: CSIS’s Victor Cha, Mike Green, and Sue Mi
    Terry.


    In this episode of The Impossible State, CSIS’s Victor Cha and Sue Mi Terry
    discuss President Trump’s “60 Minutes” interview and we discuss what to
    expect at the next Trump-Kim Jong-un summit. Plus, the latest chapter in
    the new edition of this podcast’s namesake, Victor Cha’s seminal book “The
    Impossible State.”


    Victor and Sue, “The Impossible State” was first published in 2012, and it
    immediately became the must-read for all who were interested in
    developments on the Korean Peninsula. What’s new in this updated edition in
    2018? And why did you call – I kind of think I know, but why did you call
    the new chapter “Whiplash”?


    VICTOR CHA: (Laughs.) So the new chapter was called “Whiplash” because that
    chapter is about Trump more than it is about the situation in North Korea.
    I mean, in many ways I ended the – I ended the first edition talking about
    the uncertainties in the future regarding North Korea. But then it’s ironic
    that the main chapter that we write for the new book is about the
    uncertainties of U.S. policy given this very unpredictable president.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: We have changed. They haven’t really changed.


    MR. CHA: Yeah. I mean, they’ve pretty much been on a steady state with this
    leader consolidating power. When I wrote this book we were working on a
    nine-month timeline, and then North Korean leader Kim Jong-il died of a
    massive stroke and they said we need the book in two months. So it ended up
    being the first book to come out after the death of Kim Jong-il, but we
    were guessing about the future and talked about a lot of the uncertainties
    within North Korea. Little did we expect that five years later the biggest
    uncertainty would be the United States.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Now, this is one of those books on the list in North Korea.
    It’s like a no-no. You cannot bring this book into North Korea. Our friend
    Evan Osnos from The New Yorker famously left it in his suitcase and brought
    it in, and the first thing they took from him at the airport was Victor’s
    book, “The Impossible State,” the previous edition.


    Sue, I believe you were in government when this came out. Tell us what you
    think about the new chapter and why it’s so important now.


    SUE MI TERRY: Because it really brings it to just better understanding now
    of what’s happening with North Korea. I think Victor said North Korea
    actually has been consistent. Even though Kim Jong-un, there was a lot of
    uncertainty when Kim Jong-un came into power, now looking back there are
    still – North Korea have a strategy, Kim Jong-un has a strategy and a plan,
    and it’s really the unpredictable wild card here now is the Trump
    administration. So I think he really needed to sort of write this chapter
    and bring us up to date. And of course, this is a required reading for my
    class at Georgetown. It was a required reading for my class at Columbia.
    And there’s a reason why North Koreans don’t like it, because he tells the
    truth. And he has a unique position from –


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Victor tells the truth.


    MS. TERRY: Yeah, Victor tells the truth, of course.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Yeah.


    MS. TERRY: And he brings that policy background and academic and scholarly
    background in writing this book. So North Koreans don’t like it, but we
    like it here.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Victor, you intended it – and it is – it’s a mainstream book.
    This is the kind of book that, you know, is at the front of Amazon stores.
    This isn’t just a scholarly book. I mean, this is for people who really
    want to understand what the impossible state is.


    MR. CHA: Yeah. I mean, there’s no theory in this book. (Laughs.)


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Right.


    MR. CHA: It is really – it was pitched at a general audience, and I’m
    gratified that a lot of people have read it. I mean, I remember when
    Michael Kirby, who was doing the U.N. commission report on North Korea, met
    with me, and he said that the chapter that we wrote on human rights was one
    of the first things that he read with regard to human rights as he was
    thinking about the commission report.


    So, yeah, I’m gratified that a wide – you know, a wide swath of society has
    read it. That’s certainly the way it was pitched. It has a lot of my
    stories in it from when I was in – from when I was in government to try to
    give it a little bit more of a personal perspective. And so I’m really glad
    that this new edition has come out and tried to, you know, bring things up
    to date.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: So, speaking of up to date, President Trump last night –
    Sunday night – went on “60 Minutes,” and a big part of the interview was
    about Kim Jong-un. What did he say?


    MR. CHA: I mean, it was extraordinary. I mean, it was just an extraordinary
    interview.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: (Laughs.) That’s pretty –


    MR CHA: I mean, first of all, Leslie Stahl asked great questions. I mean,
    she really pushed him. And what I was really struck by was, first, you
    know, he reaffirmed his love for the North Korean leader. She asked him, do
    you still love him, and he said, yes, I do. (Laughs.)


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Which was pretty mind-blowing.


    MR. CHA: Yeah, yeah. That, and then he also reaffirmed that he actually
    trusted the North Korean leader. And, you know, Stahl challenged him on his
    human rights record and all these other things, and she just – you know, he
    insisted that he – that he trusted this leader. I was saying earlier the
    thing that really struck me about the interview is when you actually watch
    the interview they did a very close-shot frame of the president as he was
    speaking about North Korea, and you look at his eyes as he’s speaking – you
    just look in – and I looked very carefully, and I really sensed either he’s
    got ice water in his veins or he truly believes what he’s saying.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Maybe a little of both. (Laughs.)


    MR. CHA: Yeah. But I really sense that he truly believes what he’s saying;
    I mean, that he really does believe that he trusts the North Korean leader
    and that he can do this differently and that he can get to a solution. I
    mean, it was really extraordinary.


    MS. TERRY: Well, I think, you know, maybe he – maybe he’s in love with Kim
    Jong-un over the exchange of the most “beautiful letters” that he has ever
    read.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: They were very “beautiful letters.”


    MS. TERRY: But I think, you know, whether he is truly enamored by Kim or
    not – and I think, you know, maybe Kim is an affable guy. President Moon
    Jae-in seems to like him. Maybe there is something about him that’s
    likeable in person. But I think another point that I wanted to make is that
    this kind of shows President Trump’s extreme transactional approach to the
    presidency. It’s almost like if there’s no meaning to, like, what’s good or
    bad. So even when you look at some other questions that he was answering,
    for example on Christine Blasey Ford, Dr. Ford’s testimony, he was
    attacking her, but then he justified it by saying he won. So that kind of
    gave me this idea, maybe he’s like this is his way of kowtowing to Kim
    Jong-un is sort of, you know, maybe he thinks this is a way to sort of get
    a better deal out of Kim. So maybe it is both, as you just mentioned.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: It doesn’t matter what he says now –


    MS. TERRY: Yeah.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: – but if in the end he wins, the United States, everybody
    wins.


    MS. TERRY: Right. Right, because I was really struck by that, like, I won,
    right? So maybe he thinks if he wins this way, by really flattering Kim,
    that justifies it.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: And clearly, we’d all like to win on North Korea.


    Victor, do you have any recommendations for the Trump administration in its
    overall approach to North Korea that you put in “Whiplash,” in the chapter?


    MR. CHA: Yeah. I mean, I think – well, certainly to keep the – keep our eye
    on the ball, which is, you know, sort of a true denuclearization. I mean,
    we’re in this because we’re trying to eliminate the nuclear threat in North
    Korea. And so keeping our eye on the ball – I mean, the North Koreans are
    throwing all sorts of other distractions out there, and the South Koreans
    are, you know, somewhat complicit in trying to move this – keep the
    diplomatic momentum going. But that’s one thing, is we got to really keep
    it on verifiable denuclearization.


    The other is that, you know, I think, as Sue said, all Trump cares about is
    winning. And then the question is always – what happens in every one of
    these interactions between Americans and North Koreans at these very high
    levels is the Americans come out and they list all the things that the
    North Koreans are willing to do, but they don’t really talk about what
    we’re going to give for those things. And so the second major sort of
    recommendation is let’s not give away too much for too little.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Right.


    MR. CHA: Right? I mean, the last thing we want is to be giving away
    equities in our alliance relationships – the exercising, troops, all this
    stuff – for a bad deal on nuclear weapons that for experts would be
    unacceptable; but for the politicians, they may have a much lower bar for
    what is acceptable in terms of saying that they’ve dealt with this threat.
    So that would be my second one, is, like, let’s not get a bad deal.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Well, let’s talk about that for a minute. Sue, are we on the
    path towards a bad deal, an unenforceable deal, a deal that we could – that
    would be untenable to experts in the United States?


    MS. TERRY: Well, unfortunately, I just think there’s a lot of dysfunction
    and chaos and lack of policy coordination within the Trump administration.
    We have, oftentimes, President Trump undermining his own officials. So, for
    example, when Secretary Pompeo on September 19th said we need
    timeline, and he gave a timeline on what he wants to see in terms of
    denuclearization, then President Trump just a couple weeks later says, oh,
    no, we don’t want to play this time game, I don’t need to play this time
    game. So he kind of sort of undermined what Pompeo said.


    So I’m with Victor here in terms of not giving away too much and having our
    eye on the ball. My concern is that because there is a lack of
    coordination, because there is a lack of – it’s just mixed messages coming
    out of the administration. I’m not sure if we are on the right path here. I
    really think North Korea has a strategy. Kim Jong-un has a plan. South
    Korea has a strategy. President Moon Jae-in has a plan. I’m just not sure
    exactly if we are on the same page among the Trump administration officials
    and President Trump in terms of our strategy.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Well, they keep showing they’re on the same page. In fact,
    today the North and the South agreed to connect the two via roads and
    railroads, and that’s a pretty big development.


    MR. CHA: Yeah, it’s a big development. I mean, it is – it’s still not
    something that they can do without violating existing sanctions, the U.N. –
    their own sanctions, their May 24th sanctions, the U.N.
    sanctions regime, and U.S. sanctions on North Korea. So, you know, I think
    they are pushing as close to the edge as they can get in terms of trying to
    get the United States to be more flexible on sanctions.


    When they did their third – when the two Korean leaders did their third
    summit, I was in Seoul that week for CSIS. And just watching all of this,
    the thing that came out of that was a whole list of these economic
    cooperation projects, which you just mentioned the railroads are one of
    them. And when I looked at that list, all that said to me was the U.S., you
    have to lift sanctions. I mean, it’s putting pressure on the United States
    to lift sanctions, again, before we’ve gotten anything really significant
    on denuclearization. So this is – you know, that’s how you start to get the
    makings of a bad deal.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Well, some would say we’ve already given them too much.


    MR. CHA: Yeah, I think some – particularly on the exercising, I think
    people – there were a number of people after the Singapore summit who felt
    that the president’s unilaterally giving up exercising was a dangerous step
    because that’s how we keep the alliance strong, is through exercising. And
    it’s not clear if he’s going to continue to call for suspension of major
    exercises, which are to be sometime next February.


    MS. TERRY: Well, I think we’re also poised to, in a way, give away more, if
    you will, because it looks like there is going to be second summit between
    Trump and Kim, and there is a lot of pressure to – for the U.S. to give
    this end of war declaration, peace declaration. There’s a lot of pressure
    from South Korea. Obviously, North Koreans are pressing it, China, Russia.
    It’s really all of them are against – you know, they’re pressing the United
    States, and I think we might give away even that peace declaration. I think
    that’s the next step.


    MR. CHA: You know, we always end up in this position, the Americans. I once
    described it as the dilemma of American reasonableness – (laughter) –


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Right.


    MR. CHA: – because what happens is, you know, everybody’s so excited to get
    North Korea to the table, right – the Russians, the South Koreans, the
    Chinese are all excited to get the North Koreans at the table – and then,
    you know, the North Koreans, you know, we want 100 from them and they give
    maybe 15, right – you know, 15 out of 100. And by any objective standards,
    that’s not acceptable. But the surrounding parties – the South Koreans, the
    Chinese, and the Russians – all look at the – you know, what the North
    Koreans, they’ve given, and they go, well, you know, it’s better than
    nothing. And if we get –


    MR. SCHWARTZ: At least they came to the table.


    MR. CHA: At least they came to the table. If we stop here, then we don’t –
    we’re not at the table anymore. So who are we going to try to convince? Are
    we going to try to convince the North Koreans to give more or are we going
    to try to convince the Americans to take less? And invariably, they always
    come to the Americans to take less, because we’re always – relatively
    speaking, we’re a much more reasonable party than the North Koreans are.
    (Laughs.) So this is – this is what always happens. And, like, that
    constellation is starting to come into formation right now.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: What kind of leverage do we have if we’re – if we continue to
    give away our leverage?


    MR. CHA: If we’re going to do a second summit, what it requires is for the
    president to set the bar high in terms of what we’re going to get if we’re
    going to give a second summit. I mean, a meeting with a president of the
    United States is not like a meeting with any other leader in the world,
    especially for North Korea. Because he can meet three times with Xi
    Jinping, he can meet with Putin, he can meet with Moon. The one he really
    wants to meet is the American president. So we should leverage that. I
    mean, we –


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Yeah.


    MS. TERRY: Yeah, the problem is President Trump wants to meet with Kim
    Jong-un. So we’ve always given away.


    MR. CHA: Yeah. Well, that’s the problem.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Well, he loves them. They’re friends.


    MS. TERRY: Yeah. And they said, there’s going to be a second summit
    regardless very, very soon. So we’re really giving away that leverage. And
    if we’re going to give away a peace declaration too, we need to make sure
    we get something out of that. But already South Koreans are sort of saying,
    well, let’s step away from declaration for declaration. Remember when that
    was a proposal, that we’re going to at least get a declaration from North
    Korea of all their nuclear missile inventory and facilities and program?
    But we’re now even talking about not doing that. South Koreans have floated
    this proposal for declaration for disablement of Yongbyon facility. So I
    just think we need to think very hard about if this summit is going to
    happen – and I think it will – exactly what Victor said. Like, what are we
    going to get for peace declaration?


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Let’s talk about the potential second summit. It’s pretty
    clear it’s going to happen. You both think it’s going to happen. When is it
    going to happen? It’s not going to happen before the midterms, right?


    MR. CHA: Yeah, there’s probably not enough time before the midterms. I
    don’t know what you think, Sue.


    MS. TERRY: I don’t think there’s enough time. Trump is going to Paris on
    November 11th to attend – it’s a celebration of the end of World
    War I. And then there’s G-20 in November – end of November, between
    November 30th and December 1st. So if he’s going to
    those two events, he’s certainly not – certainly not leaving, again, the
    country in mid-November, unless he has a stopover when he goes to Paris,
    maybe in Switzerland or Sweden. That’s the earliest he could possibly do
    it. But, again, I think we’re running out of time. Again, of course, unless
    Kim Jong-un comes to Washington or Mar-a-Lago or –


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Is that a real possibility? Is that –


    MR. CHA: Oh, I think – maybe not the second summit – but I think Trump
    wants to host Kim Jong-un at Mar-a-Lago. That would be – you know, that
    would be the biggest event.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: At Mar-a-Lago?


    MR. CHA: Yeah, at Mar-a-Lago. That would be the biggest television
    spectacle that you can imagine. You know, I mean, he would love that.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Talk about made for TV.


    MR. CHA: Made for TV. He would absolutely love that.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: And it would enshrine Mar-a-Lago, of course, as, you know,
    diplomatic ground zero.


    MR. CHA: Right. Right, exactly. And he’s hosted all the other major Asian
    leaders there. He’s hosted Abe there, the prime minister of Japan.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Yeah, the famous golden golf club.


    MR. CHA: Yeah, the golden golf club. (Laughs.) He’s hosted Xi Jinping
    there. It was their first meeting where –


    MS. TERRY: Had beautiful chocolate cake together.


    MR. CHA: Beautiful chocolate – his granddaughter sung a Chinese song.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Yeah.


    MR. CHA: For Xi. You know, so he – you know, I think he really feels like
    he likes to host the Asian leaders there. And this would be, like, the
    ultimate for him, I think – just the ultimate.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Oh, boy. Well, we’ll have to wait and see, I guess. And
    that’s what the president always says. He says: Well, we’ll wait and see. I
    think you all have made pretty clear that some of the stuff that they’ve
    done has been constructive.


    MR. CHA: Sure. Yeah, absolutely. And I think the idea of holding out a
    second summit now and allowing Pompeo and Biegun to start working-level
    negotiations –


    MR. SCHWARTZ: This is Steve Biegun, the – yeah, the representative.


    MR. CHA: Steve Biegun, the special representative, senior envoy for North
    Korea, who is essentially Pompeo’s right-hand man.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Yeah.


    MR. CHA: So if Pompeo is Trump’s right-hand man on North Korea, then Biegun
    is Pompeo’s right-hand man on North Korea.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Got it.


    MR. CHA: I mean, we’re now set up now with, you know, Biegun doing
    working-level meetings, Pompeo doing meetings, all for the purpose of a
    second summit. That’s now starting to look like a more normal negotiating
    process. That’s the way you’re supposed to do it, not the way that happened
    this past summer where we did the summit first without any agreements that
    were made in advance. So that’s a positive thing, I think. And then the
    other positive thing is at least when Pompeo came back from his trip to
    south Korea he said that the North Koreans might be interested in allowing
    outside inspectors in to inspect the decommissioning of the nuclear test
    site, which they blew up the tunnels for a bunch of journalists in the
    summer.


    I mean, that’s good in the sense that it’s starting to establish a norm of
    outside verification of whatever North Korea does on its weapons programs.
    And that’s something that they hadn’t agreed to in the past. So those are
    positive things. But these are still small steps. They’re not the – like we
    said, you have to keep your eye on the ball. The main thing is, you know,
    the declaration, a comprehensive declaration, verification and a timeline
    of dismantlement. And those three things have not been scratched yet.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: And for our part, we’re still trying to exert leverage. I
    mean, last week Jonathan Cheng of The Wall Street Journal reported that
    U.S. officials are preventing American aid workers from making humanitarian
    trips to North Korea. What about that?


    MR. CHA: I mean, I think that’s really unfortunate. These humanitarian aid
    groups are largely – they’re working on public health issues. There’s a
    drug resistant strain of tuberculosis in the country. And that’s very
    serious. I mean, if those people migrate to China, you know, this could be
    a disaster. So, and usually they’re always – there has always been in
    existing U.N. sanctions a humanitarian carve out. But it appears as though
    there has been this blanket refusal recently of all these visas for
    humanitarian groups. And that’s – you know, that is – you know, whether
    that’s actually a bargaining chip presumes that the regime in North Korea
    cares about the public health of these people who are outside the elite.
    I’m not really sure they care. So I don’t know if that makes it a
    bargaining chip.


    MS. TERRY: No, I 100 percent agree. We shouldn’t be punishing the normal
    North Koreans. Hepatitis, tuberculosis which is highest, I think, in the
    world, malaria, all of this is totally endemic in North Korea. I think half
    of North Korea’s children suffer from malnutrition. There’s half of
    children living in rural areas don’t have drinking water. I mean, they have
    serious problems. And as Victor just pointed out, I don’t think the North
    Korean regime would at least really care. They can just go on without these
    people. So they don’t care about the suffering of these people.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: So this isn’t real leverage. Stopping this isn’t real
    leverage.


    MS. TERRY: No, it’s not. I don’t think so.


    MR. CHA: I don’t think so. I don’t think it’s real leverage. And I don’t
    really know the full story behind it, and I don’t think even in Jonathan
    Cheng’s Wall Street Journal piece –


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Right. It was unclear why they did this.


    MR. CHA: It’s not clear why they did this, yeah. So I don’t think we have a
    full picture of what is actually driving this. But it is certainly a change
    in the policy from what we’ve seen in the past that has a real impact on
    the welfare of the average North Korean. Not the elite, but the average –
    the average North Korean.


    Just to cross-plug another CSIS product, you know, Steve Morrison in our
    Global Health Security Program has just put together this fantastic video
    on the public health situation in North Korea that really addresses some of
    these questions about the things Sue talked about – TB, malaria, and all
    these other diseases because of malnutrition and lack of a public health
    infrastructure in the country.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: I mean, this is really an extraordinary moment, though, when
    you’ve got the president of the United States continuing to profess his
    love for the North Korean leader. You have catastrophic things going on
    inside North Korea, like we just described. And now, U.S. aid workers not
    being able to go there. What do you think happens next? Do you think that
    there’s more back and forth between the U.S. and North Korea? Does – do the
    South Koreans help us step this up? What’s the plan here?


    MR. CHA: So I think the big enchilada now is this second summit. And is
    there going to be enough progress made on denuclearization for the United
    States to agree to a second summit? And from a South Korean perspective, is
    there going to be U.S. flexibility on lifting sanctions, so that the South
    can start to pursue their inter-Korean economic cooperation agenda? And
    then – and then the other question is, where is Putin going to fit into all
    this, right, because I think there is some questions of whether he will –
    Kim will meet Putin. And then, where does Japan fit in all this? Because
    they are – Japan is sort of the odd man out at this point.


    MS. TERRY: We know, first of all, Kim Jong-un had seven summits in five
    months, right? He met with Xi Jinping three times, Moon Jae-in three times,
    once with Trump. And then it looks like –


    MR. CHA: He’s busier than the U.N. secretary-general, right?


    MS. TERRY: I know. I know, he is. And then now he’s going to Russia. He
    will meet with Putin. Apparently Xi Jinping will come to Pyongyang. And
    then Kim Jong-un is supposed to go to South Korea, which is going to be
    huge – just the reception in South Korea. It’s just going to be just a big
    show. And now the Japanese have said they want to open a liaison office in
    Pyongyang to talk about abduction issues. So he is – Kim Jong-un is fully
    engaged in all of this summitry and diplomacy. And just my concern is I
    think we’re just going to meet with Kim Jong-un, again, President Trump
    will, in the second summit.


    And not only is sort of, you know, are we talking about sanctions, but I’m
    concerned that there’s going to be a peace declaration. And it’s not that
    I’m concerned about just giving a peace declaration. I just think that if
    there is going to be one, there needs to be something we get back from
    North Korea. And we should have a crystal-clear understanding – agreement
    on what that looks like in terms of definition, in terms of condition, in
    terms of intentions, because we saw in Singapore, with Singapore
    declaration, after there was a lot of confusion about the order, the
    sequencing, what we mean by denuclearization. So if there is going to be a
    peace declaration, we need to have a crystal-clear understanding by all
    parties.


    MR. CHA: Nobody’s against peace, right? Everybody’s for peace. But we know
    this is something that the North Koreans want. So we have to make sure we
    get what we want from that. And, you know, frankly, allowing a few
    inspectors into a test site that they’ve already cleaned out –


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Doesn’t cut it.


    MR. CHA: Doesn’t cut it. Promising to resell the five-megawatt reactor at
    Yongbyon, which has already been the subject of the last two agreements,
    you know, for this, you know, really paradigm-shifting agreement to some
    sort of peace declaration –


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Yeah, it’s like how many times can you trot out that old
    horse?


    MR. CHA: Right. Yeah, yeah. I mean, there was a famous saying that the
    Obama administration used. And I mean, Sue knows this well because she was
    in it, right? We’re not going to buy the same horse a third time.


    MR. SCHWARTZ: Yeah.


    MS. TERRY: Secretary Gates said it.


    MR. CHA: Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, I mean, we look like we may be on that
    path again. And that would not be a positive outcome, I think, from a U.S.
    negotiating perspective.
