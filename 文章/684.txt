SCOTT MILLER: I’m Scott.

WILLIAM ALAN REINSCH: I’m Bill.

MR. MILLER and MR. REINSCH: (Together.) And we’re The Trade Guys.

(Music plays.)

H. ANDREW SCHWARTZ: You’re listening to The Trade Guys, a podcast produced by CSIS, where we talk about trade in terms that everyone can understand. I’m H. Andrew Schwartz. And I’m here with Scott Miller and Bill Reinsch, the CSIS Trade Guys.

This week on The Trade Guys, we’re talking services. The rise of transportation, travel, communications, financial services and more have reshaped the global economy and trade policy in the last 20 years. But is Washington embracing the new services economy? We’ll discuss all that and more on this episode of The Trade Guys.

The Trade Guys are really lucky today.  We’re here with Christine Bliss, who’s the president of the Coalition of Service Industries.  Christine has a lot of expertise. She was previously the assistant U.S. Trade Representative for service, investment, telecommunications and ecommerce and she was responsible for overseeing all multilateral, regional and bilateral negotiations and policy issues for those areas within USTR.

Christine, welcome to The Trade Guys.

CHRISTINE BLISS: Well, thank you. It’s great to be here. And I really feel now like services has made it, that I was invited to be on the program. This is great.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Well, Bill and Scott are really excited because we’ve been talking about steel.

MR. REINSCH: We’ve been talking about cars and steel for the last three months. Finally, we can talk about something else – and soybeans.

MR. MILLER: It’s a great relief to – (laugh) – change the subject for once.

MS. BLISS: Well, you may not be that relieved because, actually, services is a big part of the picture on cars and soybeans.

MR. REINSCH: Well, explain about – explain that, about cars and soybeans.

MS. BLISS: OK.

MR. SCHWARTZ: So before we – before we – let’s back up. Before you go and do that, here at The Trade Guys, we think that we provide a service. We’re trying to educate and –

MR. REINSCH: But do we export the service?

MR. SCHWARTZ: – and entertain. But are we a service? Or what is a service? Explain to our listeners what a service is.

MS. BLISS: OK. Well, there are certainly attempts at more wonky technical definitions of what is a service. But what we like to do at CSI is to say you can’t make it, move it or distribute it in any way without a service. And it’s a simpler way of just trying to illustrate that there is almost no aspect of our daily lives that aren’t impacted by or don’t rely on services. And in fact, all of us are engaged primarily in services activities. So, yes –

MR. SCHWARTZ: So The Trade Guys are a service.

MS. BLISS: So The Trade Guys are definitely a service.

MR. SCHWARTZ: I knew we were providing a service.

MR. REINSCH: And a great public service, too, I just wanted to say that.

MS. BLISS: You’re a great public service.

MR. MILLER: And we’re digitally enabled.

MS. BLISS: And you’re a digitally enabled service.

MR. MILLER: And we do export our services –

MS. BLISS: Exactly.

MR. MILLER: – because we have foreign listeners.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Our producer, Fran, is here and she’s providing a service.

MS. BLISS: Well, but Scott actually – maybe this gets a little too wonky. So when services rules were first developed, it was thought by the economists that you needed to sort of talk about the different ways that services are delivered. So I will just use maybe one bit of technical terminology, but –

MR. SCHWARTZ: Nothing gets too wonky for Scott.

MS. BLISS: OK.

MR. MILLER: That’s why I’m here.

MR. REINSCH: But you’ve lost me already. (Laughter.)

MS. BLISS: OK. There you go.

MR. SCHWARTZ: We are – I am sorry.

MS. BLISS: So there are basically what are called four modes or ways that services are delivered.

MR. MILLER: Got it.

MS. BLISS: They’re delivered on a cross-border basis, meaning that you, Scott, are sitting here –

MR. MILLER: I’m in Washington.

MS. BLISS: – in Washington.

MR. MILLER: And I have a listener in Belgium.

MS. BLISS: In Belgium, exactly. So you are delivering a cross-border service in the sense you’re talking into the microphone. I don’t know if you’re broadcast, how you’re delivered, you’re streamed over the internet. But as a result, that service is electronically digitized, sent over the internet to the consumer in Belgium. So that’s an example of a cross-border service.

MR. MILLER: OK, makes sense.

MS. BLISS: But interestingly, there can also be a Belgian who comes to the United States and maybe they’re a tourist and maybe they go to their local American Express office and they say, oh, I’m out of money or they go to a local ATM and they say, oh, I need some cash. The minute that they press that button, put in their card, get the cash out of the ATM, that’s also a service.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Right.

MS. BLISS: And that is a cross-border service as well.

MR. REINSCH: That’s a service export.

MS. BLISS: It’s a service export and it’s delivered in the United States.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Interesting.

MS. BLISS: So there’s the cross-border piece that works both ways. Scott, delivering his message to the person in Belgium; the Belgian coming to the United States getting money out of the ATM.

Then there are two more modes which a lot of people, I know Bill certainly is not one of them, but forget about. And the first one is investment or called commercial presence. And what’s interesting about services is the biggest portion of services from the United States is actually as a result of foreign direct investment. And so it’s U.S. parents, their subs, affiliates abroad providing a service locally and then sending whatever it is that they need, asking for whatever they need from their U.S. parent. So that back-and-forth, that’s also a way a service is delivered.

MR. REINSCH: So that would be, like, what, a law firm or an architects’ firm?

MS. BLISS: It could be an insurance –

MR. REINSCH: But not an automobile plant.

MS. BLISS: Well –

MR. MILLER: Well, now, let’s take a package delivery. So we have FedEx picks up the package, sends it to Memphis, Tennessee, which is their U.S. hub, but the package is on its way to Shanghai. And so there is a FedEx distribution center in Shanghai –

MS. BLISS: Exactly.

MR. MILLER: – that receives the package, delivers it to the – to the ultimate recipient and sort of remits all the paperwork electronically to FedEx Memphis.

MR. SCHWARTZ: What happens when the package ends up with Tom Hanks on the island and Wilson and that whole thing?

MR. MILLER: Then somebody makes a movie.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yeah, all right. (Laughter.)

MS. BLISS: Or somebody gets fired I was going to say. (Laughter.) But anyway, yes.

MR. MILLER: Yeah, one or the other.

MS. BLISS: Yes, one or the other. So what’s interesting – and I don’t want this to get too complicated, because that’s one of the things about services. You can kind of wrap yourself into a pretzel when you think about all the ways that services can be delivered. But the delivery example that Scott brought up could be a combination of cross-border in the sense that there might be something in Memphis, maybe some paperwork that has to be done and processed in Memphis that’s sent across the border that’s used by that hub that’s in Shanghai or wherever it is in China.

MR. MILLER: Correct.

MS. BLISS: So it would be both via the investment that’s made and the airlines or the airplanes they have in China that are shipping, delivering those packages, as well as that cross-border piece as well.

But back to Bill, though. And this is the fourth mode, and that is by the entry of people into the foreign territory of another country or into the U.S., and that is also a very, very important way that services are delivered.

MR. SCHWARTZ: So this is tourism.

MS. BLISS: Well, no, not –

MR. MILLER: Well, more likely it’s an assignment of a – of a – of an official or an executive. For instance, I used to work for a big company in Cincinnati. I was assigned to work in their Toronto office for three years. OK?

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yeah, OK.

MR. MILLER: I was a mode-four service export to Canada for the three years.

MR. SCHWARTZ: You, Scott, were an export.

MR. MILLER: I was an export. And then I was reimported to the United States.

MR. SCHWARTZ: I love it. I love it.

MR. MILLER: “Return to sender,” as it were. (Laughter.)

MS. BLISS: But maybe the easiest way of –

MR. REINSCH: That would be Elvis, right?

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

MS. BLISS: Maybe the easiest way of –

MR. SCHWARTZ: Don’t get me started.

MS. BLISS: – thinking about it is that we’re talking about people that themselves are services suppliers.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Right.

MS. BLISS: So they’re not tourists.

MR. MILLER: No, right.

MS. BLISS: They’re the ones that are doing your computer processing if they’re coming into the United States or vice-versa you, Bill, might be going over to Belgium to do some consulting. If you, you know, for example, if you had a business that did environmental consulting, you might go over there, be hired. Or if you were a lawyer, you might fly in.

MR. REINSCH: OK. So what – what about students?

MS. BLISS: Students –

MR. REINSCH: Students who come here, foreign students who come to the United States.

MS. BLISS: Right. They would be consuming a service in the United States, so that would be an export. Right?

MR. MILLER: Like the tourist at the ATM.

MS. BLISS: Exactly.

MR. REINSCH: Yes.

MS. BLISS: Right.

MR. REINSCH: So their tuition is an export, a services export.

MR. MILLER: Correct.

MR. REINSCH: Is that mode four because it’s a person?

MS. BLISS: No, no, because the student is not the service supplier.

MR. REINSCH: Oh, all right.

MS. BLISS: It’s the educational institution that’s providing the service to the foreign student.

MR. REINSCH: OK. And the student is paying for it.

MR. MILLER: Yes.

MS. BLISS: Exactly.

MR. MILLER: And now you know why no one tweets about services.

MR. SCHWARTZ: OK. (Laughter.) All right, all right, all right, because –

MS. BLISS: So, no, you’re right. You’re right. But that’s the barrier we’re trying to break through.

MR. MILLER: Understood.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yeah.

MS. BLISS: And so that’s why we do try and say things like you can’t make it, buy it, sell it, move it without a service –

MR. REINSCH: Correct.

MS. BLISS: – because it’s literally that pervasive.

MR. REINSCH: OK. But wait a minute, you did three out of four modes: cross-border, commercial presence, people. What’s the – what’s the –

MS. BLISS: No, no, no, no. The second mode was mode two.

MR. REINSCH: Which is what?

MS. BLISS: And that’s consumption, internal consumption.

MR. REINSCH: Oh. Oh, all right.

MR. MILLER: Consumption by a foreigner.

MR. REINSCH: I see. OK.

MS. BLISS: Right, right, right, right. That’s mode two.

MR. REINSCH: We didn’t number them properly, I guess.

MS. BLISS: Right.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Bill hasn’t had his coffee yet today. It’s one of those things.

MS. BLISS: Exactly.

MR. MILLER: That’s right. Let’s be careful with the we here.

MR. REINSCH: I did have a bagel, though, so I’m ahead of the game.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Oh, good, good.

MR. REINSCH: OK, I get it. Good.

MS. BLISS: But I know that among many other things that Bill has done, he’s spent a lot of time on that fourth category, mode four, where it’s the people themselves that are supplying the service.

MR. MILLER: Movement of persons, yes.

MS. BLISS: Right.

MR. REINSCH: Yes, which is, in part, a controversial thing –

MS. BLISS: Yes.

MR. REINSCH: – because it’s a lot of – it’s all the H-1Bs, right?

MS. BLISS: Right.

MR. REINSCH: It’s the – it’s the –

MR. SCHWARTZ: Visas to come study here in the United States.

MR. REINSCH: To come work here in the United States.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Oh, come work here.

MS. BLISS: Come work here, right.

MR. REINSCH: It’s all the Indians that work in Silicon Valley doing software coding, among other things.

MS. BLISS: Right, exactly.

MR. REINSCH: Not just engineers –

MR. SCHWARTZ: Or engineers – yeah, engineers who are coming here, science, technicians, all kinds of people.

MR. REINSCH: Yes.

MS. BLISS: Right. It’s specialty occupations.

MR. SCHWARTZ: One of – one of my – one of my staff members is from Ireland and he was here on an H-1B until he got his green card. So we – so it’s all over.

MR. REINSCH: Yes. Yes.

MR. SCHWARTZ: It’s prevalent.

MS. BLISS: Fashion models can be H-1B. That’s another category.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Interesting.

MS. BLISS: It’s really specialty occupations, not students.

MR. REINSCH: This was an issue with the first lady, was it not? Melania was a –

MR. SCHWARTZ: Fashion model who came on an H-1B visa.

MR. REINSCH: A service – she was a service export, yes.

MR. SCHWARTZ: I’m not going to call the first lady a service export. (Laughter.)

MR. MILLER: She’s no longer a service export, she’s the first lady.

MR. REINSCH: She’s the first lady.

MR. MILLER: The first lady.

MR. SCHWARTZ: OK.

MR. REINSCH: All right. But there ought to be a lesson there for the president when we do immigration policy. But that’s another story.

MR. SCHWARTZ: That’s another story for sure.

MR. REINSCH: Yes.

MS. BLISS: Right.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Well, the president talks a lot about goods. And the U.S. goods trade deficit with China grew from 83 billion (dollars) in 2001 to 375 billion (dollars) in 2017, so that’s the story that he’s talking about, that scenario that he and his trade advisors are constantly talking about.

The other side of this is that on services, the U.S. maintains a consistent trade surplus in services. Can you tell us about that?

MS. BLISS: Yes. So particularly on the export side, we have about – right now, I think it’s around 40 billion (dollars) in services export surplus. And on the –

MR. REINSCH: To China.

MS. BLISS: To China, yeah.

MR. REINSCH: Yeah.

MS. BLISS: And on the investment side, interestingly, our investment into China has declined somewhat, China’s investment in the United States has declined precipitously. But you’re absolutely right, over the long term, we have maintained a services surplus with China.

MR. MILLER: And this is in education, travel and tourism? What are the – what are the sectors?

MS. BLISS: Yeah. So definitely travel and tourism would be one of them. Also, what would show up would be the licensing fees that are paid for intellectual property, so licensing, royalties, that counts.

MR. MILLER: Oh, OK, royalties, yes.

MS. BLISS: But the ones that we really focus on and think are so important and where we can really grow jobs and build and promote the services sector –

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yeah, this is what I wanted to know.

MS. BLISS: – are things like other business services. And what that covers are things like financial services.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Banking.

MS. BLISS: Banking, insurance in particular.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Investments.

MS. BLISS: For example, just to give you an example, the securities rating service, like S&P Global, just recently set up shop in China for the first time, I believe.

MR. SCHWARTZ: OK.

MS. BLISS: And so that would be an example of a financial service where you’d go over, establish to provide the service. And it would be an example of U.S. market access.

Similarly, China in the last two years announced loosening in the on insurance, so it’s easier to get a larger share of insurance companies in China.

MR. REINSCH: Has that actually happened? They announced it, but –

MS. BLISS: Well, they announced it. It’s still in limbo, I would say. Another area that’s still in limbo – United States won a case against China in the credit card area. And U.S. credit card companies are still waiting to be awarded licenses to provide their cards in China, even though we won that case I think it was back in 2011/2012.

MR. SCHWARTZ: And that’s the kind of thing that would really benefit us in terms of a trade surplus I would think.

MS. BLISS: Well, I would separate the two. So the trade surplus goes to what we’re able to do right now.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yeah.

MS. BLISS: And that’s a good thing. And as Scott was saying, a lot of that surplus is from things like travel and tourism and licensing. Some of it is from areas like financial services.

MR. REINSCH: Sure.

MS. BLISS: But not as much as there could be and should be. So to answer your question, so the credit card piece is not reflected in that surplus. We want it to be, but it’s not there yet.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yeah. But it seems to me that the services side of trade is a pretty good story for the United States versus the goods side which is not such a great story for the United States.

MS. BLISS: That’s absolutely right. And what it also points to is the importance of making sure that services is a really key part of the U.S. trade agenda going forward.

MR. MILLER: Because that’s a big part of the upside we have –

MS. BLISS: Absolutely.

MR. MILLER: – in the rest of the world. If you think about sort of the world-class financial services, banking and insurance companies who are succeeding in this intensely competitive U.S. market, they have skills, they have – they have – they have products and platforms that would be of great interest to consumers elsewhere in the world and they have trouble getting in and serving those customers.

MR. SCHWARTZ: So we’re much better at this point at doing things like that as a country than making things. Is that right?

MR. MILLER: Well, we’re great at making some things as well.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yeah.

MR. MILLER: We make high-tech things better than anybody in the world.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes, right.

MR. MILLER: Machine tools and high-technology equipment, airplanes and things like that.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yeah.

MR. MILLER: You want a toy airplane, it’s not going to be made in the U.S. But you want a real airplane, go to Boeing. OK?

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yeah.

MR. MILLER: So we do make some great things, but we also have a key edge in services, mostly because of how competitive and open the U.S. economy is. It’s forced the best to the top.

MS. BLISS: And can I also add to that that I, you know, I think, even as services companies, as a service association, we think the manufacturing sector in the United States is very important, just like agriculture is very important. But you’re right, what Scott is saying is true, is that what has happened in the United States – and it should be a good thing – is that the manufacturing that goes on here is a lot of smart manufacturing so that it’s more high-end, the most technologically advanced, the most productive.

And the reason I’m making that point is this is where I think services really ties into the administration’s agenda. So in promoting manufacturing, you really need to be promoting those services that support manufacturing and agriculture.

MR. MILLER: So you think of a John Deere tractor, which is sort of an iconic American implement for agriculture. But the most – the latest John Deere tractors are autonomous. They tap into the satellite. They distribute fertilizer and seeds according to mapping that’s done, geospatial mapping that’s read by the tractor. They drive themselves through the field. This is – those are all services that are embedded in that device, in that vehicle. So that combination is what makes many sort of U.S.-made products the best in the world, not just because they’re great products, but because of the services that are embedded and networked into the – into the operation of the vehicle.

MS. BLISS: And, you know, another image that we like to make or to paint for people is, when you see that tractor driving down the field, think of it with a whole crowd of people surrounding it, right?

MR. MILLER: Right.

MS. BLISS: Because it’s not just the farmer driving the tractor, it’s all the other, the analysts, the experts, the technicians that are supplying services that follow right along.

MR. MILLER: That’s just somebody at the factory in Moline monitoring the performance of the engine in real time.

MS. BLISS: Exactly. Exactly.

MR. SCHWARTZ: That’s a really interesting way to look at this.

MR. MILLER: It’s a fascinating thing.

MR. REINSCH: Well, it’s an important way to look at it because my reaction when you talked about this is, you know, that’s one less job with an autonomous tractor, you know –

MS. BLISS: But it’s not.

MR. SCHWARTZ: But it’s really not.

MR. REINSCH: But that’s the point, it’s not.

MR. MILLER: It’s a lot of jobs. And indeed, the farmer, being a large primate who makes tools, has got other things to do with his or her time. And so they can be better deployed rather than just sitting there driving, so it actually works very well for both the farmer and all the support people who help make it go.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Are you able to quantify those jobs?

MS. BLISS: Well, quantify them in the sense that they show up in various studies that are done. For example, the OECD did a study and really looked at the role between services and manufacturing. And I think there, the figure they came up with is about 60 percent of the jobs in manufacturing – and this, I think, was an average over multiple sectors – was about 60 percent. So I can’t give you, you know, X million, but just to give you an idea of the magnitude.

There’s another measure that’s out there – and I don’t have a number on the tip of my tongue – but it is being measured, and I think our Commerce Department is looking at trying to do this more – is for every goods export, there’s a certain value or amount of services that’s embedded in that goods export. And that doesn’t really show up. And that’s not –

MR. SCHWARTZ: I see.

MS. BLISS: Anyway.

MR. SCHWARTZ: So who are the CSI – not to confuse with the television show – Coalition of Service Industries – who are your members?

MS. BLISS: So my members are really a cross-section of, quote/unquote, “service suppliers,” meaning they’re companies that you go to to move, to finance, to distribute, to set up your telecom networks, your IT networks, that you go to for software. So we have members ranging from Chubb Insurance, Citibank, JPMorgan, to Google, Amazon, Walmart.

MR. SCHWARTZ: I’ve heard of those.

MS. BLISS: Right. But then we also – and many of those companies interestingly – and then the credit card companies like Mastercard, Visa, but also median entertainment, so Disney –

MR. SCHWARTZ: I was going to ask you about median entertainment. That has to play – that’s always – that’s always been one of America’s greatest exports is our cultural –

MS. BLISS: Right, and still is. And the interesting thing this, as you know, that’s happening there is it’s not just that traditional sector that we think of, the familiar names, but you’ve got Amazon, you’ve got Netflix, you’ve got others –

MR. SCHWARTZ: Right.

MS. BLISS: – that are producing content. So it’s really that broad spectrum of services industries. And this association has been around since 1982 and it really started when people started to look at the idea of services and how important they were in the economy and shouldn’t we be developing trade rules.

MR. SCHWARTZ: So what are some of the tough issues that your members face in the international trade space?

MS. BLISS: So two baskets. There are, on the one hand, there are traditional kinds of trade barriers, like limits on the amount of foreign investing that you can do. There’s also the idea of whether, on a cross-border basis, you have to actually establish to provide that cross-border service. Like Scott, would he be prohibited in Belgium from providing his service across border?

MR. SCHWARTZ: I would hope not.

MS. BLISS: Well, no, and that’s a good – a good thing.

MR. MILLER: But it’s actually an open question. So these are the market access issues that services companies face.

MS. BLISS: Right. Right, but –

MR. SCHWARTZ: I mean, everybody wants Scott all over the world, we want to give the people what they want.

MS. BLISS: Well, Scott’s special –

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yeah.

MS. BLISS: – so maybe we should –

MR. MILLER: But if you think about American movies, there are –

MR. SCHWARTZ: Wait until I get to Bill. You think he’s special? (Laughter.)

MR. REINSCH: Let’s do movies. Is a movie – is a movie a service or is a movie a good?

MS. BLISS: Well, so there is the digital content, so when a movie is transmitted electronically, then it is digital content. So it’s not technically a service, but it is transmitted via a service. So it’s becoming more complicated, though, because in addition, now content is often streamed, so streaming itself is a service and maybe a little different than just electronically transmitting.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Distribution is a service.

MS. BLISS: Right.

MR. SCHWARTZ: The product is a good.

MS. BLISS: Right.

MR. REINSCH: Well, no, I don’t think – I don’t think Disney would say a movie is a good either.

MS. BLISS: No, I don’t – that is –

MR. REINSCH: That’s a complicated question.

MS. BLISS: That has been a grey area for a long time. I think they would say, when you have the film in the can, the old-fashioned –

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yeah.

MS. BLISS: – then that could be a good and there would be a tariff classification.

MR. MILLER: Yeah, it was an object, it had weight, it had mass.

MS. BLISS: Exactly. Exactly.

MR. MILLER: Yeah, that was –

MR. SCHWARTZ: When we used to have record albums, that was a good.

MR. MILLER: Right.

MS. BLISS: Or even when it was on a floppy disk, that’s when it got a bit more complicated, but at least there was a physical thing. But now that you have digital content, it’s all broken down into bits.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Right.

MS. BLISS: Then Bill’s right, that’s not necessarily a digital service, but it’s generally referred to as a product, a digital product. And the way that the United States and other countries have treated that is to say you should give that digital product nondiscriminatory treatment.

MR. MILLER: But when Disney – let’s say it’s Disney wanting to show films in, let’s say, China or anyplace with screen quotas –

MS. BLISS: Right.

MR. MILLER: – OK, the first barrier they didn’t face was transmitting the bits, OK, and getting the movie, the digital content into the country. But then they are limited to the number of screens they can use, so there are other market access barriers behind the border.

MS. BLISS: Right, there are. And not that we want to go down that road because it can get more complicated, but there is an old case that was brought against China with respect to their barriers in the audio-visual sector and to movies in particular and the way that was resolved was by negotiating a certain number of films that can be sold in China every year. So in that sense, there still is the traditional barrier that has to be faced, even though the movies themselves are now digitized and being streamed electronically.

MR. REINSCH: A classic example of managed trade, actually.

MR. MILLER: Yes, that’s right.

MS. BLISS: Right.

MR. REINSCH: They cut a deal, you get so many movies and that was it.

MR. MILLER: And then, of course, it’s overcome by technologies because we all watch movies on our laptops these days.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yeah, or iPads or even phones.

MR. MILLER: Phones.

MS. BLISS: But that leads me to the second bucket, whereas we still care about the traditional bucket of trade barriers, we’ve now very much focused – and this is true across the spectrum of services sectors on digital trade barriers – and the two number one – and they come in different forms – are barriers to cross-border data flows and data localization requirements. And what I mean by that is, if, in order to provide your service in a foreign country and, for example, you’re a credit card company, it could mean that you can’t use your server in Denver to process that credit card payment, you have to set up a server in Vietnam and you have to set up a server in every country that literally would require that, which is prohibitive, is going to deter those companies from setting up abroad and really prevent market access.

MR. REINSCH: So why do countries have that requirement? What’s their motivation to say that you have to have the server in their country?

MS. BLISS: Well, clearly, one of the big motivations is just pure protectionism, that they’re afraid that if they don’t do that then they’re not going to develop their own competitive industries –

MR. REINSCH: They’re own, yeah.

MS. BLISS: – and Vietnam is a good example of that. Another reason that’s used, but it can also frequently be abused, is national security.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Right.

MS. BLISS: That they have – you know, that they’ve got to control whatever data comes in, goes out. Another argument that’s used are things like money laundering and that they have to keep track of every single financial transaction in the currency that comes in and comes out. So there are multiple reasons that countries use.

But the argument we generally make is that if you – if you impose that kind of requirement, ultimately the data that flows back and forth is going to be less secure.

MR. SCHWARTZ: OK. So which countries have the toughest service markets to enter?

MS. BLISS: Well, depending on the side you’re looking in, certainly China continues to have major barriers to services.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Ah-ha.

MS. BLISS: And if you’re asking me which areas as examples, I would say financial services is still carved up. Yes, they have let in some market opening where they want to, where they think it’s to their advantage. So in the insurance sector, there’s been some loosening.

And you’re right, Bill, it hasn’t been fully implemented yet.

But there’s still a part of the services market that they’ve not opened up. The ICT and digital part of the market is still very, very closed.

MR. REINSCH: Information, communications, technology, OK?

MS. BLISS: Yes, thank you. And I use that term shorthand to refer to telecom companies that lay the pipes, have the fiber, and also the internet services companies, like Google, Facebook, others, Amazon, that provide the software and the services online. And Microsoft is another one. And the reason I’m bringing up that example is cloud services, which I think Scott referred to, are an incredibly important advance and a very equalizing advance because particularly developing countries with poorer populations, by virtue of technology have incredibly expanded opportunities. And this is particularly true in the agricultural area.

MR. MILLER: Well, this is the story of Africa.

MS. BLISS: Absolutely.

MR. MILLER: In Africa, when it came to landlines for telephones, there were, like, hundred-year waiting lists from the government-run monopoly phone company, and all of a sudden, everybody has a mobile phone and it has made incredible differences in people’s lives –

MS. BLISS: Right.

MR. MILLER: – OK, and their ability to connect with markets, to understand what’s going on in the world. It’s just – it’s been – it’s been lifechanging.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Well, you’ve already hinted at this, but which are the industries that are most likely to be targeted as trade restrictive?

MS. BLISS: Oh, you mean most likely to face barriers?

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yeah, most – yes, most likely to –

MS. BLISS: Well, so I would say it’s really the historical, the industries that are the ones where, you know, you have to go outside of the United States to get to your markets. And since only about 5 percent of the consumer base, the demand is here, it’s – so it’s really down the line – financial services, telecom companies, the internet services companies, logistics, professional services to a large degree, particularly in areas like construction services, architects, engineers and median entertainment.

MR. SCHWARTZ: So this is an enormous landscape.

MS. BLISS: Yes.

MR. SCHWARTZ: And within this landscape, what’s your take on the administration’s trade policy?

MS. BLISS: So really from the beginning of –

MR. SCHWARTZ: I mean, are they neglecting services?

MS. BLISS: I wouldn’t say neglecting. But I think from the beginning, we’ve been concerned to make sure that we could get out there and do as much educating as possible. And so the message has really been threefold: don’t forget about services because of the constant service surplus globally, particularly with respect to certain countries, including China. To that, you need to make sure that services continues to be competitive and you need to address barriers that are faced because of the way in which they’re helping manufacturing, which is clearly a big priority in this – in this administration. And three, we make a similar case with respect to agriculture, that it’s also a part of promoting agriculture exports. And then the last piece is small business.

MR. SCHWARTZ: So how do you figure in to the new USMCA deal? And how do you figure in with the trade war with China?

MS. BLISS: Well, taking the USMCA first, we were very appreciative of the fact that the administration essentially took and approved upon the five, six chapters that we always watch in U.S. FTAs and they took a lot of what had been agreed to in TPP, so cross-border services, telecom, financial services, investment, digital trade, and they based the language in those chapters largely on TPP with some improvements.

MR. SCHWARTZ: The Trans-Pacific Partnership.

MS. BLISS: Yes. And so we’ve been very happy, in large part, with the way negotiations have gone in the USMCA for those five chapters. There’s still some issues that we have that are out there, but to answer your question, at least in the context of USMCA – I’m still getting used to that acronym –

MR. SCHWARTZ: We are, too. We like to sing the Village People song just to remind us of the – of the letters.

MS. BLISS: Yes.

MR. REINSCH: You know, we did that in my class last week. We called up the video and –

MR. SCHWARTZ: At University of Maryland, shout out to Maryland. OK.

MR. REINSCH: Yes. And the thing we learned is that in the original video, they don’t do the hand things, they don’t do the Y and the M and the C and the A.

MR. SCHWARTZ: That was made up subsequently.

MR. REINSCH: That was, yes.

MR. SCHWARTZ: It was a national craze.

MR. REINSCH: It was knockoff videos that would do that.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yeah, national craze, continues to be.

MR. REINSCH: There was a lot of fashion victims in 1978, let me tell you. (Laughter.) It’s an amazing video to watch.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Some people think – you know what? Some people think that the ’70s had better fashion than now. I’m not one of them.

MR. REINSCH: Who thinks that?

MR. SCHWARTZ: I’m not one of them.

MR. MILLER: That group of “some” is pretty small.

MS. BLISS: Yeah, I think so. (Laughter.) I think so, yeah.

MR. REINSCH: Tell us about –

MS. BLISS: Anyway, so the USMCA. So there’s been a lot of good progress and important things that have been agreed to in the USMCA in those chapters. There’s still some areas where we have some concerns. We’re still looking at the agreement as a whole, haven’t made up our minds, ultimately.

MR. SCHWARTZ: What are you concerned about?

MS. BLISS: Well, for example, a number of our companies who are companies that handle the goods part as well as being the service supplier, like the logistics companies and like a company like Amazon or Google or Walmart, they care very much about customs procedures. So one of the good things that happened in this agreement was the degree to which customs procedures were streamlined, which is a plus.

But one of the elements that was part of that was trying to raise the de minimis level. And there was an increase, but I think companies felt – their hope, it could have been a bigger increase.

MR. REINSCH: This is the level below which stuff can come in without paying any duty –

MS. BLISS: Right.

MR. REINSCH: – or without doing a lot of paperwork.

MS. BLISS: So it’s important, especially for small companies, small importers. So that’s one piece.

And then there also is a provision in the agreement that says the U.S. can reciprocally reduce its own de minimis level, which right now was set at $800, which was seen as a big legislative victory. And so companies just want to make sure that that never happens.

MR. REINSCH: But it would take Congress to do that, right? Because that’s in law.

MS. BLISS: Right. So that’s concerning. And then, although for financial services there was a huge win, and that is, for the first time ever, there’s a prohibition on data localization barriers in financial services. That had never been included in a trade agreement. But alternatively, a lot of concern about the carve-back in investor-state dispute settlement, narrower protections which continue to be really important to services, so nervousness about that.

And then the last thing – I won’t give you a big laundry list – is procurement. And there, there is real concern because what happened in the agreement is for Canada there are no procurement commitments and you just have to rely on their existing WTO commitments. And for the financial services crowd, that’s not good because there are no financial services commitments.

On the Mexico side, they’re basically just bound at NAFTA 1.0. And in that regard, there are no commitments on financial services, so also a concern there because U.S. financial services companies have a very, very big stake, particularly in the Mexican market.

MR. SCHWARTZ: So you still need to work through a bunch of things with the USMCA.

MS. BLISS: Well, we’re thinking about all those things. But at the same time, we’re recognizing there are some very good things. So it’s really looking across the board.

MR. SCHWARTZ: All right. What about China?

MS. BLISS: So for China, it’s second-largest U.S. services export market, huge potential, investment is very important in that regard. And so if your question is really, what about on the tariff side, what is that doing for services –

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yeah.

MS. BLISS: What we’re concerned about, and we’ve said this publicly, is that, as the tariffs have escalated, it’s affected and is affecting services in two ways. One is there are those companies that actually have goods that are involved in the services that they supply, their services are wrapped around the product in one way or another. And a lot of those items were on the most recent list that was approved for tariffs, so that’s a concern.

But then there’s also the concern, what happens when you reach the limit? If China counter retaliates and then reached the limit of U.S. exports, what’s left? And it’s services, basically. And so we’re concerned about potential counter retaliation on non-tariff areas and services.

MR. MILLER: So these are services delivered beyond the border into China, but affected by domestic regulation.

MS. BLISS: Right.

MR. MILLER: Yeah.

MS. BLISS: So licensing.

MR. MILLER: Right.

MS. BLISS: So it is of great concern. So what we’ve said was we think we know that the Chinese practices subject to the 301 investigation are egregious, need to be addressed, but we just think engaging in negotiation is the way forward.

MR. SCHWARTZ: So how do you keep services in the forefront with an administration that is trying to keep goods in the forefront?

MS. BLISS: Well, as I say, it’s a constant round of activities of meeting with the administration, making our arguments, putting on events like the Global Services Summit.

MR. SCHWARTZ: I mean, do you feel like they’re hearing you when you meet with them?

MS. BLISS: I think there is – for example, we had Kevin Hassett, chairman of the CEA, at the summit, who was talking about the importance of the services sector in the economy. I don’t think we’ve ever had a CEA chair at the services summit, so I think that’s progress. We had Secretary Ross at the summit last year, talked about the importance of services. This year, we had Undersecretary Kaplan deliver a similar kind of message. We’ve had a meeting with Deputy USTR Mahoney, who’s in charge of services, who also said, you know, we get it, we know services is important. So I don’t think it’s the case that there’s a complete lack of recognition. I think it’s just, you know, we have to keep pushing and we have to keep making the case.

Similarly on the Hill, we undergo the same exercise. And I think on the Hill, we have, over the years, built a better base of understanding about the importance of services.

MR. REINSCH: It’s a smart thing to invite officials to an event because they’ll want to show up because it’s exposure, it’s a chance to articulate the administration’s position, whatever it is. But they also know if they’re coming to your event they have to talk about services. There’s no point in coming to the services summit and talking about cars. So that means they have to prepare and in the process –

MR. SCHWARTZ: And they have to have something to say.

MR. REINSCH: They have to have something to say.

MS. BLISS: Right.

MR. REINSCH: So in the process, they learn about it and they cough something up that might or might not be useful.

MS. BLISS: No, that’s absolutely right. And that’s why, for example, we were so appreciative that Chairman Hassett was willing to come because, you know, he gave his perspective, which we might not agree with a hundred percent, but at the same time he talked a lot about the services economy and –

MR. REINSCH: He was the one, was he not, that referred to all previous trade negotiators, presumably including you, as feckless. Is that right?

MS. BLISS: Yes. Yes.

MR. REINSCH: You didn’t punch him out?

MS. BLISS: No. No. (Laughter.) You know, we’re thin – we’re very thick-skinned, but you have to be so –

MR. MILLER: Look, CSI is a great example of a – of an industry moving its issues forward and staying out of the Twitter timeline, which probably both have benefits.

MS. BLISS: (Chuckles.) We hope so.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Well, if you need guests at your summit next year, invite The Trade Guys.

MS. BLISS: We will definitely do that.

MR. REINSCH: We actually have done that in other contexts.

MR. MILLER: Yes, yeah. Yeah.

MR. REINSCH: We did it for WITA.

MR. MILLER: Yeah, we – (inaudible) – once in a while, so we’d be delighted to be part of your event.

MS. BLISS: I think that would be great. I absolutely am –

MR. REINSCH: Not that we’re soliciting or anything.

MS. BLISS: No, no, no.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Nothing like a Trade Guys roadshow.

MS. BLISS: And let me also return to say I know, you know, we follow all the great work that CSIS does all the time, so if we can work with you to create maybe more of a program on services, that would be great.

MR. SCHWARTZ: We’re there. All right.

MR. REINSCH: Just remember there’s only one letter difference between you and us.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yeah, that’s right. And people confuse us with the TV show, too.

MR. REINSCH: It’s the S. (Laughter.)

MR. SCHWARTZ: So, you know, I mean –

MR. MILLER: Not often.

MR. SCHWARTZ: You’d be surprised.

MR. REINSCH: I don’t think we look like the people on that show, but –

MR. SCHWARTZ: Well, you know –

MR. REINSCH: This is Mark Harmon and that’s –

MR. SCHWARTZ: On a good day.

MR. REINSCH: That’s “NCIS.”

MR. MILLER: That’s “NCIS.”

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yeah, yeah.

MR. REINSCH: Not CSI –

MR. MILLER: Also, just one letter off, so –

MS. BLISS: Yeah. (Laughter.)

(Music plays.)

MR. SCHWARTZ: To our listeners, if you have a question for The Trade Guys, write us at TradeGuys@CSIS.org. That’s TradeGuys@CSIS.org. We’ll read some of your emails and have The Trade Guys react to it.

Thank you, Trade Guys.

MR. MILLER: Thanks, Andrew.

MR. REINSCH: Thank you.

        Services, You Can’t Trade Without ‘Em
October 24, 2018Stream the podcast here.


SCOTT MILLER: I’m Scott.

WILLIAM ALAN REINSCH: I’m Bill.

MR. MILLER and MR. REINSCH: (Together.) And we’re The Trade Guys.

(Music plays.)

H. ANDREW SCHWARTZ: You’re listening to The Trade Guys, a podcast produced by CSIS, where we talk about trade in terms that everyone can understand. I’m H. Andrew Schwartz. And I’m here with Scott Miller and Bill Reinsch, the CSIS Trade Guys.

This week on The Trade Guys, we’re talking services. The rise of transportation, travel, communications, financial services and more have reshaped the global economy and trade policy in the last 20 years. But is Washington embracing the new services economy? We’ll discuss all that and more on this episode of The Trade Guys.

The Trade Guys are really lucky today.  We’re here with Christine Bliss, who’s the president of the Coalition of Service Industries.  Christine has a lot of expertise. She was previously the assistant U.S. Trade Representative for service, investment, telecommunications and ecommerce and she was responsible for overseeing all multilateral, regional and bilateral negotiations and policy issues for those areas within USTR.

Christine, welcome to The Trade Guys.

CHRISTINE BLISS: Well, thank you. It’s great to be here. And I really feel now like services has made it, that I was invited to be on the program. This is great.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Well, Bill and Scott are really excited because we’ve been talking about steel.

MR. REINSCH: We’ve been talking about cars and steel for the last three months. Finally, we can talk about something else – and soybeans.

MR. MILLER: It’s a great relief to – (laugh) – change the subject for once.

MS. BLISS: Well, you may not be that relieved because, actually, services is a big part of the picture on cars and soybeans.

MR. REINSCH: Well, explain about – explain that, about cars and soybeans.

MS. BLISS: OK.

MR. SCHWARTZ: So before we – before we – let’s back up. Before you go and do that, here at The Trade Guys, we think that we provide a service. We’re trying to educate and –

MR. REINSCH: But do we export the service?

MR. SCHWARTZ: – and entertain. But are we a service? Or what is a service? Explain to our listeners what a service is.

MS. BLISS: OK. Well, there are certainly attempts at more wonky technical definitions of what is a service. But what we like to do at CSI is to say you can’t make it, move it or distribute it in any way without a service. And it’s a simpler way of just trying to illustrate that there is almost no aspect of our daily lives that aren’t impacted by or don’t rely on services. And in fact, all of us are engaged primarily in services activities. So, yes –

MR. SCHWARTZ: So The Trade Guys are a service.

MS. BLISS: So The Trade Guys are definitely a service.

MR. SCHWARTZ: I knew we were providing a service.

MR. REINSCH: And a great public service, too, I just wanted to say that.

MS. BLISS: You’re a great public service.

MR. MILLER: And we’re digitally enabled.

MS. BLISS: And you’re a digitally enabled service.

MR. MILLER: And we do export our services –

MS. BLISS: Exactly.

MR. MILLER: – because we have foreign listeners.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Our producer, Fran, is here and she’s providing a service.

MS. BLISS: Well, but Scott actually – maybe this gets a little too wonky. So when services rules were first developed, it was thought by the economists that you needed to sort of talk about the different ways that services are delivered. So I will just use maybe one bit of technical terminology, but –

MR. SCHWARTZ: Nothing gets too wonky for Scott.

MS. BLISS: OK.

MR. MILLER: That’s why I’m here.

MR. REINSCH: But you’ve lost me already. (Laughter.)

MS. BLISS: OK. There you go.

MR. SCHWARTZ: We are – I am sorry.

MS. BLISS: So there are basically what are called four modes or ways that services are delivered.

MR. MILLER: Got it.

MS. BLISS: They’re delivered on a cross-border basis, meaning that you, Scott, are sitting here –

MR. MILLER: I’m in Washington.

MS. BLISS: – in Washington.

MR. MILLER: And I have a listener in Belgium.

MS. BLISS: In Belgium, exactly. So you are delivering a cross-border service in the sense you’re talking into the microphone. I don’t know if you’re broadcast, how you’re delivered, you’re streamed over the internet. But as a result, that service is electronically digitized, sent over the internet to the consumer in Belgium. So that’s an example of a cross-border service.

MR. MILLER: OK, makes sense.

MS. BLISS: But interestingly, there can also be a Belgian who comes to the United States and maybe they’re a tourist and maybe they go to their local American Express office and they say, oh, I’m out of money or they go to a local ATM and they say, oh, I need some cash. The minute that they press that button, put in their card, get the cash out of the ATM, that’s also a service.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Right.

MS. BLISS: And that is a cross-border service as well.

MR. REINSCH: That’s a service export.

MS. BLISS: It’s a service export and it’s delivered in the United States.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Interesting.

MS. BLISS: So there’s the cross-border piece that works both ways. Scott, delivering his message to the person in Belgium; the Belgian coming to the United States getting money out of the ATM.

Then there are two more modes which a lot of people, I know Bill certainly is not one of them, but forget about. And the first one is investment or called commercial presence. And what’s interesting about services is the biggest portion of services from the United States is actually as a result of foreign direct investment. And so it’s U.S. parents, their subs, affiliates abroad providing a service locally and then sending whatever it is that they need, asking for whatever they need from their U.S. parent. So that back-and-forth, that’s also a way a service is delivered.

MR. REINSCH: So that would be, like, what, a law firm or an architects’ firm?

MS. BLISS: It could be an insurance –

MR. REINSCH: But not an automobile plant.

MS. BLISS: Well –

MR. MILLER: Well, now, let’s take a package delivery. So we have FedEx picks up the package, sends it to Memphis, Tennessee, which is their U.S. hub, but the package is on its way to Shanghai. And so there is a FedEx distribution center in Shanghai –

MS. BLISS: Exactly.

MR. MILLER: – that receives the package, delivers it to the – to the ultimate recipient and sort of remits all the paperwork electronically to FedEx Memphis.

MR. SCHWARTZ: What happens when the package ends up with Tom Hanks on the island and Wilson and that whole thing?

MR. MILLER: Then somebody makes a movie.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yeah, all right. (Laughter.)

MS. BLISS: Or somebody gets fired I was going to say. (Laughter.) But anyway, yes.

MR. MILLER: Yeah, one or the other.

MS. BLISS: Yes, one or the other. So what’s interesting – and I don’t want this to get too complicated, because that’s one of the things about services. You can kind of wrap yourself into a pretzel when you think about all the ways that services can be delivered. But the delivery example that Scott brought up could be a combination of cross-border in the sense that there might be something in Memphis, maybe some paperwork that has to be done and processed in Memphis that’s sent across the border that’s used by that hub that’s in Shanghai or wherever it is in China.

MR. MILLER: Correct.

MS. BLISS: So it would be both via the investment that’s made and the airlines or the airplanes they have in China that are shipping, delivering those packages, as well as that cross-border piece as well.

But back to Bill, though. And this is the fourth mode, and that is by the entry of people into the foreign territory of another country or into the U.S., and that is also a very, very important way that services are delivered.

MR. SCHWARTZ: So this is tourism.

MS. BLISS: Well, no, not –

MR. MILLER: Well, more likely it’s an assignment of a – of a – of an official or an executive. For instance, I used to work for a big company in Cincinnati. I was assigned to work in their Toronto office for three years. OK?

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yeah, OK.

MR. MILLER: I was a mode-four service export to Canada for the three years.

MR. SCHWARTZ: You, Scott, were an export.

MR. MILLER: I was an export. And then I was reimported to the United States.

MR. SCHWARTZ: I love it. I love it.

MR. MILLER: “Return to sender,” as it were. (Laughter.)

MS. BLISS: But maybe the easiest way of –

MR. REINSCH: That would be Elvis, right?

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

MS. BLISS: Maybe the easiest way of –

MR. SCHWARTZ: Don’t get me started.

MS. BLISS: – thinking about it is that we’re talking about people that themselves are services suppliers.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Right.

MS. BLISS: So they’re not tourists.

MR. MILLER: No, right.

MS. BLISS: They’re the ones that are doing your computer processing if they’re coming into the United States or vice-versa you, Bill, might be going over to Belgium to do some consulting. If you, you know, for example, if you had a business that did environmental consulting, you might go over there, be hired. Or if you were a lawyer, you might fly in.

MR. REINSCH: OK. So what – what about students?

MS. BLISS: Students –

MR. REINSCH: Students who come here, foreign students who come to the United States.

MS. BLISS: Right. They would be consuming a service in the United States, so that would be an export. Right?

MR. MILLER: Like the tourist at the ATM.

MS. BLISS: Exactly.

MR. REINSCH: Yes.

MS. BLISS: Right.

MR. REINSCH: So their tuition is an export, a services export.

MR. MILLER: Correct.

MR. REINSCH: Is that mode four because it’s a person?

MS. BLISS: No, no, because the student is not the service supplier.

MR. REINSCH: Oh, all right.

MS. BLISS: It’s the educational institution that’s providing the service to the foreign student.

MR. REINSCH: OK. And the student is paying for it.

MR. MILLER: Yes.

MS. BLISS: Exactly.

MR. MILLER: And now you know why no one tweets about services.

MR. SCHWARTZ: OK. (Laughter.) All right, all right, all right, because –

MS. BLISS: So, no, you’re right. You’re right. But that’s the barrier we’re trying to break through.

MR. MILLER: Understood.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yeah.

MS. BLISS: And so that’s why we do try and say things like you can’t make it, buy it, sell it, move it without a service –

MR. REINSCH: Correct.

MS. BLISS: – because it’s literally that pervasive.

MR. REINSCH: OK. But wait a minute, you did three out of four modes: cross-border, commercial presence, people. What’s the – what’s the –

MS. BLISS: No, no, no, no. The second mode was mode two.

MR. REINSCH: Which is what?

MS. BLISS: And that’s consumption, internal consumption.

MR. REINSCH: Oh. Oh, all right.

MR. MILLER: Consumption by a foreigner.

MR. REINSCH: I see. OK.

MS. BLISS: Right, right, right, right. That’s mode two.

MR. REINSCH: We didn’t number them properly, I guess.

MS. BLISS: Right.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Bill hasn’t had his coffee yet today. It’s one of those things.

MS. BLISS: Exactly.

MR. MILLER: That’s right. Let’s be careful with the we here.

MR. REINSCH: I did have a bagel, though, so I’m ahead of the game.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Oh, good, good.

MR. REINSCH: OK, I get it. Good.

MS. BLISS: But I know that among many other things that Bill has done, he’s spent a lot of time on that fourth category, mode four, where it’s the people themselves that are supplying the service.

MR. MILLER: Movement of persons, yes.

MS. BLISS: Right.

MR. REINSCH: Yes, which is, in part, a controversial thing –

MS. BLISS: Yes.

MR. REINSCH: – because it’s a lot of – it’s all the H-1Bs, right?

MS. BLISS: Right.

MR. REINSCH: It’s the – it’s the –

MR. SCHWARTZ: Visas to come study here in the United States.

MR. REINSCH: To come work here in the United States.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Oh, come work here.

MS. BLISS: Come work here, right.

MR. REINSCH: It’s all the Indians that work in Silicon Valley doing software coding, among other things.

MS. BLISS: Right, exactly.

MR. REINSCH: Not just engineers –

MR. SCHWARTZ: Or engineers – yeah, engineers who are coming here, science, technicians, all kinds of people.

MR. REINSCH: Yes.

MS. BLISS: Right. It’s specialty occupations.

MR. SCHWARTZ: One of – one of my – one of my staff members is from Ireland and he was here on an H-1B until he got his green card. So we – so it’s all over.

MR. REINSCH: Yes. Yes.

MR. SCHWARTZ: It’s prevalent.

MS. BLISS: Fashion models can be H-1B. That’s another category.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Interesting.

MS. BLISS: It’s really specialty occupations, not students.

MR. REINSCH: This was an issue with the first lady, was it not? Melania was a –

MR. SCHWARTZ: Fashion model who came on an H-1B visa.

MR. REINSCH: A service – she was a service export, yes.

MR. SCHWARTZ: I’m not going to call the first lady a service export. (Laughter.)

MR. MILLER: She’s no longer a service export, she’s the first lady.

MR. REINSCH: She’s the first lady.

MR. MILLER: The first lady.

MR. SCHWARTZ: OK.

MR. REINSCH: All right. But there ought to be a lesson there for the president when we do immigration policy. But that’s another story.

MR. SCHWARTZ: That’s another story for sure.

MR. REINSCH: Yes.

MS. BLISS: Right.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Well, the president talks a lot about goods. And the U.S. goods trade deficit with China grew from 83 billion (dollars) in 2001 to 375 billion (dollars) in 2017, so that’s the story that he’s talking about, that scenario that he and his trade advisors are constantly talking about.

The other side of this is that on services, the U.S. maintains a consistent trade surplus in services. Can you tell us about that?

MS. BLISS: Yes. So particularly on the export side, we have about – right now, I think it’s around 40 billion (dollars) in services export surplus. And on the –

MR. REINSCH: To China.

MS. BLISS: To China, yeah.

MR. REINSCH: Yeah.

MS. BLISS: And on the investment side, interestingly, our investment into China has declined somewhat, China’s investment in the United States has declined precipitously. But you’re absolutely right, over the long term, we have maintained a services surplus with China.

MR. MILLER: And this is in education, travel and tourism? What are the – what are the sectors?

MS. BLISS: Yeah. So definitely travel and tourism would be one of them. Also, what would show up would be the licensing fees that are paid for intellectual property, so licensing, royalties, that counts.

MR. MILLER: Oh, OK, royalties, yes.

MS. BLISS: But the ones that we really focus on and think are so important and where we can really grow jobs and build and promote the services sector –

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yeah, this is what I wanted to know.

MS. BLISS: – are things like other business services. And what that covers are things like financial services.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Banking.

MS. BLISS: Banking, insurance in particular.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Investments.

MS. BLISS: For example, just to give you an example, the securities rating service, like S&P Global, just recently set up shop in China for the first time, I believe.

MR. SCHWARTZ: OK.

MS. BLISS: And so that would be an example of a financial service where you’d go over, establish to provide the service. And it would be an example of U.S. market access.

Similarly, China in the last two years announced loosening in the on insurance, so it’s easier to get a larger share of insurance companies in China.

MR. REINSCH: Has that actually happened? They announced it, but –

MS. BLISS: Well, they announced it. It’s still in limbo, I would say. Another area that’s still in limbo – United States won a case against China in the credit card area. And U.S. credit card companies are still waiting to be awarded licenses to provide their cards in China, even though we won that case I think it was back in 2011/2012.

MR. SCHWARTZ: And that’s the kind of thing that would really benefit us in terms of a trade surplus I would think.

MS. BLISS: Well, I would separate the two. So the trade surplus goes to what we’re able to do right now.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yeah.

MS. BLISS: And that’s a good thing. And as Scott was saying, a lot of that surplus is from things like travel and tourism and licensing. Some of it is from areas like financial services.

MR. REINSCH: Sure.

MS. BLISS: But not as much as there could be and should be. So to answer your question, so the credit card piece is not reflected in that surplus. We want it to be, but it’s not there yet.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yeah. But it seems to me that the services side of trade is a pretty good story for the United States versus the goods side which is not such a great story for the United States.

MS. BLISS: That’s absolutely right. And what it also points to is the importance of making sure that services is a really key part of the U.S. trade agenda going forward.

MR. MILLER: Because that’s a big part of the upside we have –

MS. BLISS: Absolutely.

MR. MILLER: – in the rest of the world. If you think about sort of the world-class financial services, banking and insurance companies who are succeeding in this intensely competitive U.S. market, they have skills, they have – they have – they have products and platforms that would be of great interest to consumers elsewhere in the world and they have trouble getting in and serving those customers.

MR. SCHWARTZ: So we’re much better at this point at doing things like that as a country than making things. Is that right?

MR. MILLER: Well, we’re great at making some things as well.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yeah.

MR. MILLER: We make high-tech things better than anybody in the world.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes, right.

MR. MILLER: Machine tools and high-technology equipment, airplanes and things like that.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yeah.

MR. MILLER: You want a toy airplane, it’s not going to be made in the U.S. But you want a real airplane, go to Boeing. OK?

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yeah.

MR. MILLER: So we do make some great things, but we also have a key edge in services, mostly because of how competitive and open the U.S. economy is. It’s forced the best to the top.

MS. BLISS: And can I also add to that that I, you know, I think, even as services companies, as a service association, we think the manufacturing sector in the United States is very important, just like agriculture is very important. But you’re right, what Scott is saying is true, is that what has happened in the United States – and it should be a good thing – is that the manufacturing that goes on here is a lot of smart manufacturing so that it’s more high-end, the most technologically advanced, the most productive.

And the reason I’m making that point is this is where I think services really ties into the administration’s agenda. So in promoting manufacturing, you really need to be promoting those services that support manufacturing and agriculture.

MR. MILLER: So you think of a John Deere tractor, which is sort of an iconic American implement for agriculture. But the most – the latest John Deere tractors are autonomous. They tap into the satellite. They distribute fertilizer and seeds according to mapping that’s done, geospatial mapping that’s read by the tractor. They drive themselves through the field. This is – those are all services that are embedded in that device, in that vehicle. So that combination is what makes many sort of U.S.-made products the best in the world, not just because they’re great products, but because of the services that are embedded and networked into the – into the operation of the vehicle.

MS. BLISS: And, you know, another image that we like to make or to paint for people is, when you see that tractor driving down the field, think of it with a whole crowd of people surrounding it, right?

MR. MILLER: Right.

MS. BLISS: Because it’s not just the farmer driving the tractor, it’s all the other, the analysts, the experts, the technicians that are supplying services that follow right along.

MR. MILLER: That’s just somebody at the factory in Moline monitoring the performance of the engine in real time.

MS. BLISS: Exactly. Exactly.

MR. SCHWARTZ: That’s a really interesting way to look at this.

MR. MILLER: It’s a fascinating thing.

MR. REINSCH: Well, it’s an important way to look at it because my reaction when you talked about this is, you know, that’s one less job with an autonomous tractor, you know –

MS. BLISS: But it’s not.

MR. SCHWARTZ: But it’s really not.

MR. REINSCH: But that’s the point, it’s not.

MR. MILLER: It’s a lot of jobs. And indeed, the farmer, being a large primate who makes tools, has got other things to do with his or her time. And so they can be better deployed rather than just sitting there driving, so it actually works very well for both the farmer and all the support people who help make it go.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Are you able to quantify those jobs?

MS. BLISS: Well, quantify them in the sense that they show up in various studies that are done. For example, the OECD did a study and really looked at the role between services and manufacturing. And I think there, the figure they came up with is about 60 percent of the jobs in manufacturing – and this, I think, was an average over multiple sectors – was about 60 percent. So I can’t give you, you know, X million, but just to give you an idea of the magnitude.

There’s another measure that’s out there – and I don’t have a number on the tip of my tongue – but it is being measured, and I think our Commerce Department is looking at trying to do this more – is for every goods export, there’s a certain value or amount of services that’s embedded in that goods export. And that doesn’t really show up. And that’s not –

MR. SCHWARTZ: I see.

MS. BLISS: Anyway.

MR. SCHWARTZ: So who are the CSI – not to confuse with the television show – Coalition of Service Industries – who are your members?

MS. BLISS: So my members are really a cross-section of, quote/unquote, “service suppliers,” meaning they’re companies that you go to to move, to finance, to distribute, to set up your telecom networks, your IT networks, that you go to for software. So we have members ranging from Chubb Insurance, Citibank, JPMorgan, to Google, Amazon, Walmart.

MR. SCHWARTZ: I’ve heard of those.

MS. BLISS: Right. But then we also – and many of those companies interestingly – and then the credit card companies like Mastercard, Visa, but also median entertainment, so Disney –

MR. SCHWARTZ: I was going to ask you about median entertainment. That has to play – that’s always – that’s always been one of America’s greatest exports is our cultural –

MS. BLISS: Right, and still is. And the interesting thing this, as you know, that’s happening there is it’s not just that traditional sector that we think of, the familiar names, but you’ve got Amazon, you’ve got Netflix, you’ve got others –

MR. SCHWARTZ: Right.

MS. BLISS: – that are producing content. So it’s really that broad spectrum of services industries. And this association has been around since 1982 and it really started when people started to look at the idea of services and how important they were in the economy and shouldn’t we be developing trade rules.

MR. SCHWARTZ: So what are some of the tough issues that your members face in the international trade space?

MS. BLISS: So two baskets. There are, on the one hand, there are traditional kinds of trade barriers, like limits on the amount of foreign investing that you can do. There’s also the idea of whether, on a cross-border basis, you have to actually establish to provide that cross-border service. Like Scott, would he be prohibited in Belgium from providing his service across border?

MR. SCHWARTZ: I would hope not.

MS. BLISS: Well, no, and that’s a good – a good thing.

MR. MILLER: But it’s actually an open question. So these are the market access issues that services companies face.

MS. BLISS: Right. Right, but –

MR. SCHWARTZ: I mean, everybody wants Scott all over the world, we want to give the people what they want.

MS. BLISS: Well, Scott’s special –

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yeah.

MS. BLISS: – so maybe we should –

MR. MILLER: But if you think about American movies, there are –

MR. SCHWARTZ: Wait until I get to Bill. You think he’s special? (Laughter.)

MR. REINSCH: Let’s do movies. Is a movie – is a movie a service or is a movie a good?

MS. BLISS: Well, so there is the digital content, so when a movie is transmitted electronically, then it is digital content. So it’s not technically a service, but it is transmitted via a service. So it’s becoming more complicated, though, because in addition, now content is often streamed, so streaming itself is a service and maybe a little different than just electronically transmitting.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Distribution is a service.

MS. BLISS: Right.

MR. SCHWARTZ: The product is a good.

MS. BLISS: Right.

MR. REINSCH: Well, no, I don’t think – I don’t think Disney would say a movie is a good either.

MS. BLISS: No, I don’t – that is –

MR. REINSCH: That’s a complicated question.

MS. BLISS: That has been a grey area for a long time. I think they would say, when you have the film in the can, the old-fashioned –

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yeah.

MS. BLISS: – then that could be a good and there would be a tariff classification.

MR. MILLER: Yeah, it was an object, it had weight, it had mass.

MS. BLISS: Exactly. Exactly.

MR. MILLER: Yeah, that was –

MR. SCHWARTZ: When we used to have record albums, that was a good.

MR. MILLER: Right.

MS. BLISS: Or even when it was on a floppy disk, that’s when it got a bit more complicated, but at least there was a physical thing. But now that you have digital content, it’s all broken down into bits.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Right.

MS. BLISS: Then Bill’s right, that’s not necessarily a digital service, but it’s generally referred to as a product, a digital product. And the way that the United States and other countries have treated that is to say you should give that digital product nondiscriminatory treatment.

MR. MILLER: But when Disney – let’s say it’s Disney wanting to show films in, let’s say, China or anyplace with screen quotas –

MS. BLISS: Right.

MR. MILLER: – OK, the first barrier they didn’t face was transmitting the bits, OK, and getting the movie, the digital content into the country. But then they are limited to the number of screens they can use, so there are other market access barriers behind the border.

MS. BLISS: Right, there are. And not that we want to go down that road because it can get more complicated, but there is an old case that was brought against China with respect to their barriers in the audio-visual sector and to movies in particular and the way that was resolved was by negotiating a certain number of films that can be sold in China every year. So in that sense, there still is the traditional barrier that has to be faced, even though the movies themselves are now digitized and being streamed electronically.

MR. REINSCH: A classic example of managed trade, actually.

MR. MILLER: Yes, that’s right.

MS. BLISS: Right.

MR. REINSCH: They cut a deal, you get so many movies and that was it.

MR. MILLER: And then, of course, it’s overcome by technologies because we all watch movies on our laptops these days.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yeah, or iPads or even phones.

MR. MILLER: Phones.

MS. BLISS: But that leads me to the second bucket, whereas we still care about the traditional bucket of trade barriers, we’ve now very much focused – and this is true across the spectrum of services sectors on digital trade barriers – and the two number one – and they come in different forms – are barriers to cross-border data flows and data localization requirements. And what I mean by that is, if, in order to provide your service in a foreign country and, for example, you’re a credit card company, it could mean that you can’t use your server in Denver to process that credit card payment, you have to set up a server in Vietnam and you have to set up a server in every country that literally would require that, which is prohibitive, is going to deter those companies from setting up abroad and really prevent market access.

MR. REINSCH: So why do countries have that requirement? What’s their motivation to say that you have to have the server in their country?

MS. BLISS: Well, clearly, one of the big motivations is just pure protectionism, that they’re afraid that if they don’t do that then they’re not going to develop their own competitive industries –

MR. REINSCH: They’re own, yeah.

MS. BLISS: – and Vietnam is a good example of that. Another reason that’s used, but it can also frequently be abused, is national security.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Right.

MS. BLISS: That they have – you know, that they’ve got to control whatever data comes in, goes out. Another argument that’s used are things like money laundering and that they have to keep track of every single financial transaction in the currency that comes in and comes out. So there are multiple reasons that countries use.

But the argument we generally make is that if you – if you impose that kind of requirement, ultimately the data that flows back and forth is going to be less secure.

MR. SCHWARTZ: OK. So which countries have the toughest service markets to enter?

MS. BLISS: Well, depending on the side you’re looking in, certainly China continues to have major barriers to services.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Ah-ha.

MS. BLISS: And if you’re asking me which areas as examples, I would say financial services is still carved up. Yes, they have let in some market opening where they want to, where they think it’s to their advantage. So in the insurance sector, there’s been some loosening.

And you’re right, Bill, it hasn’t been fully implemented yet.

But there’s still a part of the services market that they’ve not opened up. The ICT and digital part of the market is still very, very closed.

MR. REINSCH: Information, communications, technology, OK?

MS. BLISS: Yes, thank you. And I use that term shorthand to refer to telecom companies that lay the pipes, have the fiber, and also the internet services companies, like Google, Facebook, others, Amazon, that provide the software and the services online. And Microsoft is another one. And the reason I’m bringing up that example is cloud services, which I think Scott referred to, are an incredibly important advance and a very equalizing advance because particularly developing countries with poorer populations, by virtue of technology have incredibly expanded opportunities. And this is particularly true in the agricultural area.

MR. MILLER: Well, this is the story of Africa.

MS. BLISS: Absolutely.

MR. MILLER: In Africa, when it came to landlines for telephones, there were, like, hundred-year waiting lists from the government-run monopoly phone company, and all of a sudden, everybody has a mobile phone and it has made incredible differences in people’s lives –

MS. BLISS: Right.

MR. MILLER: – OK, and their ability to connect with markets, to understand what’s going on in the world. It’s just – it’s been – it’s been lifechanging.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Well, you’ve already hinted at this, but which are the industries that are most likely to be targeted as trade restrictive?

MS. BLISS: Oh, you mean most likely to face barriers?

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yeah, most – yes, most likely to –

MS. BLISS: Well, so I would say it’s really the historical, the industries that are the ones where, you know, you have to go outside of the United States to get to your markets. And since only about 5 percent of the consumer base, the demand is here, it’s – so it’s really down the line – financial services, telecom companies, the internet services companies, logistics, professional services to a large degree, particularly in areas like construction services, architects, engineers and median entertainment.

MR. SCHWARTZ: So this is an enormous landscape.

MS. BLISS: Yes.

MR. SCHWARTZ: And within this landscape, what’s your take on the administration’s trade policy?

MS. BLISS: So really from the beginning of –

MR. SCHWARTZ: I mean, are they neglecting services?

MS. BLISS: I wouldn’t say neglecting. But I think from the beginning, we’ve been concerned to make sure that we could get out there and do as much educating as possible. And so the message has really been threefold: don’t forget about services because of the constant service surplus globally, particularly with respect to certain countries, including China. To that, you need to make sure that services continues to be competitive and you need to address barriers that are faced because of the way in which they’re helping manufacturing, which is clearly a big priority in this – in this administration. And three, we make a similar case with respect to agriculture, that it’s also a part of promoting agriculture exports. And then the last piece is small business.

MR. SCHWARTZ: So how do you figure in to the new USMCA deal? And how do you figure in with the trade war with China?

MS. BLISS: Well, taking the USMCA first, we were very appreciative of the fact that the administration essentially took and approved upon the five, six chapters that we always watch in U.S. FTAs and they took a lot of what had been agreed to in TPP, so cross-border services, telecom, financial services, investment, digital trade, and they based the language in those chapters largely on TPP with some improvements.

MR. SCHWARTZ: The Trans-Pacific Partnership.

MS. BLISS: Yes. And so we’ve been very happy, in large part, with the way negotiations have gone in the USMCA for those five chapters. There’s still some issues that we have that are out there, but to answer your question, at least in the context of USMCA – I’m still getting used to that acronym –

MR. SCHWARTZ: We are, too. We like to sing the Village People song just to remind us of the – of the letters.

MS. BLISS: Yes.

MR. REINSCH: You know, we did that in my class last week. We called up the video and –

MR. SCHWARTZ: At University of Maryland, shout out to Maryland. OK.

MR. REINSCH: Yes. And the thing we learned is that in the original video, they don’t do the hand things, they don’t do the Y and the M and the C and the A.

MR. SCHWARTZ: That was made up subsequently.

MR. REINSCH: That was, yes.

MR. SCHWARTZ: It was a national craze.

MR. REINSCH: It was knockoff videos that would do that.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yeah, national craze, continues to be.

MR. REINSCH: There was a lot of fashion victims in 1978, let me tell you. (Laughter.) It’s an amazing video to watch.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Some people think – you know what? Some people think that the ’70s had better fashion than now. I’m not one of them.

MR. REINSCH: Who thinks that?

MR. SCHWARTZ: I’m not one of them.

MR. MILLER: That group of “some” is pretty small.

MS. BLISS: Yeah, I think so. (Laughter.) I think so, yeah.

MR. REINSCH: Tell us about –

MS. BLISS: Anyway, so the USMCA. So there’s been a lot of good progress and important things that have been agreed to in the USMCA in those chapters. There’s still some areas where we have some concerns. We’re still looking at the agreement as a whole, haven’t made up our minds, ultimately.

MR. SCHWARTZ: What are you concerned about?

MS. BLISS: Well, for example, a number of our companies who are companies that handle the goods part as well as being the service supplier, like the logistics companies and like a company like Amazon or Google or Walmart, they care very much about customs procedures. So one of the good things that happened in this agreement was the degree to which customs procedures were streamlined, which is a plus.

But one of the elements that was part of that was trying to raise the de minimis level. And there was an increase, but I think companies felt – their hope, it could have been a bigger increase.

MR. REINSCH: This is the level below which stuff can come in without paying any duty –

MS. BLISS: Right.

MR. REINSCH: – or without doing a lot of paperwork.

MS. BLISS: So it’s important, especially for small companies, small importers. So that’s one piece.

And then there also is a provision in the agreement that says the U.S. can reciprocally reduce its own de minimis level, which right now was set at $800, which was seen as a big legislative victory. And so companies just want to make sure that that never happens.

MR. REINSCH: But it would take Congress to do that, right? Because that’s in law.

MS. BLISS: Right. So that’s concerning. And then, although for financial services there was a huge win, and that is, for the first time ever, there’s a prohibition on data localization barriers in financial services. That had never been included in a trade agreement. But alternatively, a lot of concern about the carve-back in investor-state dispute settlement, narrower protections which continue to be really important to services, so nervousness about that.

And then the last thing – I won’t give you a big laundry list – is procurement. And there, there is real concern because what happened in the agreement is for Canada there are no procurement commitments and you just have to rely on their existing WTO commitments. And for the financial services crowd, that’s not good because there are no financial services commitments.

On the Mexico side, they’re basically just bound at NAFTA 1.0. And in that regard, there are no commitments on financial services, so also a concern there because U.S. financial services companies have a very, very big stake, particularly in the Mexican market.

MR. SCHWARTZ: So you still need to work through a bunch of things with the USMCA.

MS. BLISS: Well, we’re thinking about all those things. But at the same time, we’re recognizing there are some very good things. So it’s really looking across the board.

MR. SCHWARTZ: All right. What about China?

MS. BLISS: So for China, it’s second-largest U.S. services export market, huge potential, investment is very important in that regard. And so if your question is really, what about on the tariff side, what is that doing for services –

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yeah.

MS. BLISS: What we’re concerned about, and we’ve said this publicly, is that, as the tariffs have escalated, it’s affected and is affecting services in two ways. One is there are those companies that actually have goods that are involved in the services that they supply, their services are wrapped around the product in one way or another. And a lot of those items were on the most recent list that was approved for tariffs, so that’s a concern.

But then there’s also the concern, what happens when you reach the limit? If China counter retaliates and then reached the limit of U.S. exports, what’s left? And it’s services, basically. And so we’re concerned about potential counter retaliation on non-tariff areas and services.

MR. MILLER: So these are services delivered beyond the border into China, but affected by domestic regulation.

MS. BLISS: Right.

MR. MILLER: Yeah.

MS. BLISS: So licensing.

MR. MILLER: Right.

MS. BLISS: So it is of great concern. So what we’ve said was we think we know that the Chinese practices subject to the 301 investigation are egregious, need to be addressed, but we just think engaging in negotiation is the way forward.

MR. SCHWARTZ: So how do you keep services in the forefront with an administration that is trying to keep goods in the forefront?

MS. BLISS: Well, as I say, it’s a constant round of activities of meeting with the administration, making our arguments, putting on events like the Global Services Summit.

MR. SCHWARTZ: I mean, do you feel like they’re hearing you when you meet with them?

MS. BLISS: I think there is – for example, we had Kevin Hassett, chairman of the CEA, at the summit, who was talking about the importance of the services sector in the economy. I don’t think we’ve ever had a CEA chair at the services summit, so I think that’s progress. We had Secretary Ross at the summit last year, talked about the importance of services. This year, we had Undersecretary Kaplan deliver a similar kind of message. We’ve had a meeting with Deputy USTR Mahoney, who’s in charge of services, who also said, you know, we get it, we know services is important. So I don’t think it’s the case that there’s a complete lack of recognition. I think it’s just, you know, we have to keep pushing and we have to keep making the case.

Similarly on the Hill, we undergo the same exercise. And I think on the Hill, we have, over the years, built a better base of understanding about the importance of services.

MR. REINSCH: It’s a smart thing to invite officials to an event because they’ll want to show up because it’s exposure, it’s a chance to articulate the administration’s position, whatever it is. But they also know if they’re coming to your event they have to talk about services. There’s no point in coming to the services summit and talking about cars. So that means they have to prepare and in the process –

MR. SCHWARTZ: And they have to have something to say.

MR. REINSCH: They have to have something to say.

MS. BLISS: Right.

MR. REINSCH: So in the process, they learn about it and they cough something up that might or might not be useful.

MS. BLISS: No, that’s absolutely right. And that’s why, for example, we were so appreciative that Chairman Hassett was willing to come because, you know, he gave his perspective, which we might not agree with a hundred percent, but at the same time he talked a lot about the services economy and –

MR. REINSCH: He was the one, was he not, that referred to all previous trade negotiators, presumably including you, as feckless. Is that right?

MS. BLISS: Yes. Yes.

MR. REINSCH: You didn’t punch him out?

MS. BLISS: No. No. (Laughter.) You know, we’re thin – we’re very thick-skinned, but you have to be so –

MR. MILLER: Look, CSI is a great example of a – of an industry moving its issues forward and staying out of the Twitter timeline, which probably both have benefits.

MS. BLISS: (Chuckles.) We hope so.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Well, if you need guests at your summit next year, invite The Trade Guys.

MS. BLISS: We will definitely do that.

MR. REINSCH: We actually have done that in other contexts.

MR. MILLER: Yes, yeah. Yeah.

MR. REINSCH: We did it for WITA.

MR. MILLER: Yeah, we – (inaudible) – once in a while, so we’d be delighted to be part of your event.

MS. BLISS: I think that would be great. I absolutely am –

MR. REINSCH: Not that we’re soliciting or anything.

MS. BLISS: No, no, no.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Nothing like a Trade Guys roadshow.

MS. BLISS: And let me also return to say I know, you know, we follow all the great work that CSIS does all the time, so if we can work with you to create maybe more of a program on services, that would be great.

MR. SCHWARTZ: We’re there. All right.

MR. REINSCH: Just remember there’s only one letter difference between you and us.

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yeah, that’s right. And people confuse us with the TV show, too.

MR. REINSCH: It’s the S. (Laughter.)

MR. SCHWARTZ: So, you know, I mean –

MR. MILLER: Not often.

MR. SCHWARTZ: You’d be surprised.

MR. REINSCH: I don’t think we look like the people on that show, but –

MR. SCHWARTZ: Well, you know –

MR. REINSCH: This is Mark Harmon and that’s –

MR. SCHWARTZ: On a good day.

MR. REINSCH: That’s “NCIS.”

MR. MILLER: That’s “NCIS.”

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yeah, yeah.

MR. REINSCH: Not CSI –

MR. MILLER: Also, just one letter off, so –

MS. BLISS: Yeah. (Laughter.)

(Music plays.)

MR. SCHWARTZ: To our listeners, if you have a question for The Trade Guys, write us at TradeGuys@CSIS.org. That’s TradeGuys@CSIS.org. We’ll read some of your emails and have The Trade Guys react to it.

Thank you, Trade Guys.

MR. MILLER: Thanks, Andrew.

MR. REINSCH: Thank you.

MR. SCHWARTZ: You’ve been listening to The Trade Guys, a CSIS podcast.
