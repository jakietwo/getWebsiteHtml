Guys on the Road: The State International Trade Development Organization Edition
February 28, 2019
    Scott Miller: I'm Scott.


    Bill Reinsch: I'm Bill.


    Scott Miller: And we're the trade guys.


    Bill Reinsch: And we're the trade guys.


    Andrew Schwartz: You're listening to the Trade Guys. A podcast produced by
    CSIS where we talk about trade in terms that everyone can understand. I'm
    H. Andrew Schwartz and I'm here with Scott Miller and Bill Reinsch the CSIS
    trade guys. In this episode we had the opportunity to record in front of an
    esteemed audience attending the State International Trade Development
    Organization or SIDO, they’re 2019 Washington forum. We did it up on
    Capitol Hill in the historic Russell Senate office building in a gorgeous,
    gorgeous room. Joining me and the Trade Guys were two State Trade Directors
    Gabrielle Gerbaud and Wade Merritt. Gabrielle is the executive director of
    the Minnesota Trade Office. Wade is the president of Maine's international
    trade center and a former SIDO president. We ask Gabrielle and Wade what
    they're hearing on the ground about USMCA about the U.S. China deal and
    about the section 232 tariffs. You'll get all that plus way more right here
    on this episode, live on Capitol Hill of the Trade Guys.


    Andrew Schwartz: We're here at small business committee. The last time Bill
    and Scott here, they were testifying, they were indicted, there were
    subpoenaed. But we're having them here under good terms. So, we're here at
    small business committee speaking at the State International Development
    Organization or SIDO their Washington forum. SIDO is a nonpartisan
    organization that's part of the NGA and the council state governments. They
    are the organization that represents the international trade directors for
    the governor and state. I love this setup. I feel like we're kind of being
    judged on the one hand. That we're being ... we're going to have to wave to
    our audience out here on the other hand.


    Scott Miller: In Portland, nobody has a gavel. We found that out. Yes.
    Right. So, we're safe for the moment [laughter].


    Andrew Schwartz: Okay. We're safe for the moment. We're joined by a couple
    of really wonderful guests, couple of state trade directors, Wade Merritt
    from Maine and Gabrielle Gerbaud from Minnesota. Thank you both for joining
    us. Wade, you're a past president of SIDO and had been with the Maine
    Department of Economic and community development for over 20 years. Why
    don't you tell us a little bit about SIDO and what state trade offices do.


    Wade Merritt: Well, thanks for having me on. Yeah, so it's been kind of a
    long strange trip. We were back in the early '90s. Found ourselves ... I
    think my first job in international trade development was photocopying
    lists of companies. That companies might be interested in doing business
    with and then faxing them. Things have changed quite a bit to find yourself
    on a podcast. But it's been a long trip. I started in the mid '90s. I was a
    frontline staff member, counseling companies. Have overtime worked my way
    up. Took the role as the state international trade director in June of
    2017. Really our jobs I think are to do exactly ... to connect our business
    community and our states really to international opportunities that can be
    in the area of export development. In our case, it also includes some work
    on the import side. And also on investment attraction and also a little bit
    on student attraction. It's a big job with a very big mandate. It's a big
    world. So, it's the idea for us is to try to make it small.


    Andrew Schwartz: And Gabrielle, you're the executive director of the
    Minnesota Trade Office, the state's official export development arm. Tell
    us what you do as director and what you're responsible for up there in
    Minnesota. And tell us how you brave the freezing cold. A couple of weeks
    ago I heard the people. I heard people's retinas were freezing and you had
    to go out with goggles on. If you were actually in public.


    Gabrielle Gerbaud: I didn't go out.


    Andrew Schwartz: Good, well your retinas look fantastic. [laughter]


    Gabrielle Gerbaud: That's why you have a heated garage.


    Andrew Schwartz: Yeah, I bet. [laughter]


    Gabrielle Gerbaud: Okay, And you layer. So, that's for that. For the trade
    matter, every day we have small and medium companies to export and to find
    the next opportunity worldwide. We do it through our ... now not only
    phenomenal team of experts that we have at the office of 10 people. But
    also with our offices internationally. That help us just find those
    opportunities. Also, we attract foreign investment and we tried to be the
    49th exceptional competence that we have with the other states. And finally
    we are the protocol office where we try to create those relationships at
    another level. That we facilitate at one point in time either trade or any
    memorandum or any future project.


    Bill Reinsch: Since we're here in the Russell Senate office building, do
    you guys work with your congressional delegations? What kind of support do
    you get from your congressional delegations? Or do you bypass them and work
    with the executive branch?


    Wade Merritt: Oh no, I think they're critical partners for us. I think, we
    have a very close relationship with all four of our congressional. We're a
    fairly small state with only four members. But which makes it easy for us
    to be able to talk with all of them. They've all been very supportive of
    us. We actually support each other pretty well in making sure that our
    voices are heard down here. But also in supporting the congressional
    offices as well. With some kind of on the ground intelligence about what's
    actually going on in the state with the business community.


    Gabrielle Gerbaud: Every year we create an amount of reports that are
    important to the state on the trade matters that we always share with our
    congressional delegation. We should be more active in the future. It has
    just changed. So, we're trying to educate everybody on what is available to
    them through our office. But there are key factor and there are key partner
    for us too.


    Bill Reinsch: Do you come to them for help? I mean, if you've got somebody
    who wants to export something somewhere and there was some obstacle, do you
    come to your senator or congressman and say, "Can you help us out with
    this?" Or can you go talk to the State Department or whoever it is in the
    executive branch? Or do you just go straight to the executive branch?


    Gabrielle Gerbaud: Actually we could but normally in Minnesota, because we
    have such an amount of a headquarters for fortune 500, they've gone
    directly. They have a relationship directly with the senators. So, they
    really don't need us for that.


    Bill Reinsch: Those are the big guys.


    Gabrielle Gerbaud: Those are the big guys.


    Bill Reinsch: But you're speaking for the small guy.


    Gabrielle Gerbaud: For the smaller guys, normally we've noticed that is
    much more powerful when they do it directly. At the end of the day they are
    the ones that vote. And we can facilitate the relationship. But at the end
    of the day, I think it's great that they speak up directly and they go
    after. And they just you know...


    Bill Reinsch: You can help do that.


    Gabrielle Gerbaud: Exactly, yes, of course.


    Bill Reinsch: Point them in the right direction.


    Wade Merritt: We're much smaller state with much smaller business
    community. We have zero fortune 500 companies that are located in our
    state. So-


    Andrew Schwartz: Great lobster rolls.


    Wade Merritt: Great lobster rolls, excellent craft beer and join us in the
    summertime. We'll see Bill there in a couple of minutes.


    Bill Reinsch: Coming in August. Yes.


    Scott Miller: The small states have their advantages.


    Wade Merritt: We do have our advantages and one of those is, easy access to
    our congressional delegation. In our case however, when we have a trade
    issue. We'll kind of judge whether the legislative route or the
    congressional route's the easier way to go. Or sometimes we'll bring in the
    executive through our work with our partner organization of the U.S.
    commercial service.


    Scott Miller: In former life, I used to lobby Senator Collins and senator
    Snowe. Because we had a main presence and first senator Snowe knew where
    every company was in Maine. She knew every town and every company in
    exhaustive knowledge. And then luckily we stumbled on the fact that the
    plant manager of our plant was a high school classmate of Susan Collins.
    So, Senator Collins had a particularly fondness for what we doing. But
    that's the small state edge in terms of your particularly senate
    representation and their deep knowledge of your specific situations.


    Wade Merritt: Well, I think that's right. And when senator Snowe retired
    and was replaced by former Governor King. Now Senator King was the governor
    that actually created our organization in the first place. He knew what
    we're doing. He knows what we're doing. And you're right. I mean, I think
    in Maine we're only a million and a half people, not even. The joke about
    the six degrees of separation in Maine it's about two. And I think you
    experience that when you ran into senator Collin's cousin.


    Bill Reinsch: I think that's true I experienced from the other perspective.
    I spent 20 years on the Hill. And most of them in this building actually
    working first for the senator from Pennsylvania and then for the senator
    from West Virginia.


    Andrew Schwartz: And senator Heinz and senator Rockefeller


    Bill Reinsch: And senator Heinz and senator Rockefeller. Right.
    Pennsylvania is a big state. It's got a lot of issues and getting the
    senator's attention was more complicated than West Virginia. Because there
    were fewer people coming in I think. And it was a lot ... a way easier I
    think for Rockefeller to do what Scott just said and what you just said and
    relocation of all these places and things just mattered more. Because there
    were fewer of them. Pennsylvania had a whole panoply of trade issues.
    Because everything that was important then in this country competed with
    somebody in Pennsylvania.


    Andrew Schwartz: You know what their biggest trade issue is right now. The
    Pittsburgh Steelers about to lose it. Antonio Brown and Le'Veon Bell
    they're the big trade issues. Am I right?


    Scott Miller: That is correct.


    Bill Reinsch: Heinz for a while on the Penguins.


    Scott Miller: Meanwhile, all my relatives are the Cleveland Browns in fan
    base.


    Andrew Schwartz: They're excited. I know.


    Wade Merritt: I got some in the back room


    Andrew Schwartz: But we digress. What are some of the biggest exports
    though from Maine?


    Wade Merritt: We're still very natural resource based. I mean this is the
    backbone of the Maine economy comes from the ocean and it comes from the
    forests. The both of those have been ... well although lobster industry has
    been seeing a pretty substantial growth. The forest products industry,
    let's just say we're in transition from kind of more traditional pulp and
    paper based. Forest based economy to what are we going to do with all this
    pulp. It's a lot of really interesting and new technologies that are coming
    out there. But that tends to be what drives us.


    Wade Merritt: We do have some smallish technology firms. We're close to
    Boston so, we've got a decent life sciences sector of people who've kind of
    made their way up the main turnpike. But our technology based sector also
    kind of flows itself back to our kind of traditional strengths. We've got a
    composites industry at advanced materials that comes directly from boat
    building. A lot of those types of things. So, still very natural resource
    based and niche manufacturing as well.


    Gabrielle Gerbaud: Well, we're not that poetic. I cannot talk about the
    forest and the ocean so badly-


    Bill Reinsch: Or the lobsters.


    Gabrielle Gerbaud: We've tried. We have ... Yeah. Try lobster from the
    lake. We have walleye. But it's of course, the medical industry, medical
    devices specifically for products, advanced manufacturing. Manufacturing's
    general. Vehicles, electric vehicles, plastics. We're very diverse economy.
    I think that that is one of our strengths. And also maybe you can always
    have the two sides of the coin. But a lot of agriculture and not only that
    but agrotechnology, the machinery that goes with it. Which is including
    manufacturing or the food … technology. So, we are very diverse in our
    industry.


    Scott Miller: Medical technology is a fascinating one because medical
    devices seem to be an industry that it's small inventors who become
    astonishingly successful when they get to get a product approved for use
    and then quickly have global mindset. So, it doesn't look like a typical
    company that scales up or an industry that gets scale. And then thinks
    about the global market. The medical device, it's first about invention.
    But the lot of little companies with amazing innovation pipelines who think
    about patients all over the world for their product. And so, it's somewhat
    unique. And what I'm wondering if does that have any spillovers and the
    rest of what goes on in terms of the human capital of Minnesota. Are there
    startups and companies that come out of the medical device industry that
    are in allied fields? Or something else that makes that intellectual home
    unique?


    Gabrielle Gerbaud: Yeah. That's an excellent question. Actually right now
    we have the commissioner of DEED, which is the Department of Employment
    Economic Development that is really focusing on startups right now because
    there is such a huge amount of startups in Minnesota devoted to those
    between many other things, Internet of things. Because I don't know if
    you've noticed, but right now instead of seeing verticals in terms of
    industry we're seeing almost diagonals. The industries are just crossing
    themselves. Internet of things is in the advanced manufacturing. They're
    not as clear as they used to be before. Before you belong to an industry
    and that's where you were stuck. Right now you're crossing industries one
    after the other. So, going to your-


    Andrew Schwartz: Interesting point.


    Wade Merritt: It's a very good point.


    Gabrielle Gerbaud: Coming back to your question, I think there is that kind
    of cradle. Again of course from Minnesota, always unknown to the world. But
    there is that kind of cradle that they're really ... those startups they're
    becoming a more and more important. Because then they have those huge
    companies that Medtronic like Start Hearing. That they really ... either
    they use their products. They use the technology or they just purchased
    them. It's kind of a little bit of an ecosystem that is happening right now
    in Minnesota. Yes


    Wade Merritt: Fascinating.


    Andrew Schwartz: In both of your states, how important is NAFTA or the new
    USMCA to your state? And how has it affected your economy? How's it been a
    net positive or has it harmed your state? And this is something we've been
    talking on the Trade Guys for a long time. I know both of our trade guys
    want to weigh in on this.


    Bill Reinsch: Well you're both border states actually.


    Wade Merritt: Yeah.


    Gabrielle Gerbaud: We are.


    Bill Reinsch: So, largest trading partners is Canada and then the second
    largest probably Mexico at least for us.


    Wade Merritt:So Yeah. Mexico is a top 10 market. But Canada definitely
    dominates the scene for us. It is 50% of what the state exports goes to
    Canada. If you break the provinces out individually, New Brunswick's number
    one. Quebec is number two. And then I think it's China number three.


    Bill Reinsch: That’s a province of Canada right? [laughter]


    Wade Merritt: Right that's a province of Canada. Yeah. No.


    Andrew Schwartz: Are you implying that the Canadians want to annex Maine?


    Bill Reinsch: No, they want to annex China.


    Wade Merritt: Lets edit this part out. [laughter]


    Scott Miller: Those border wars were contentious at one point. [laughter]


    Wade Merritt: No, but that's an interesting point though. And one that I
    was going to make actually is that, in our case Maine, New Brunswick,
    Quebec existed before there was even a country. I mean, this was in a lot
    of ways, this was a line that was drawn through an existing economy. There
    are family ties, there are business connections, there are all sorts of
    ties that cross that border.


    Scott Miller: That's a great point. When I speak to student groups, I have
    a question. When did free trade in North America began? And the grinders
    will say 1995 or 1994 when NAFTA went into force. And the clever ones will
    say, well, sometime before 1789.


    Wade Merritt: Yeah. I mean, it kind of gets into our mindset and our psyche
    a little bit. I mean, I think that there's certainly a picture from our
    Maine perspective that the folks in Atlanta, Canada and Quebec are more of
    our cousins and our business partners. The disputes that happen between
    those jurisdictions tend to be more familial. They tend to be kind of
    small. Access to that market whether it's you're going over there to do
    business. Or in some cases when we were talking about instituting passport
    control for the northern border. You were talking about people having to
    have their passport to go to church in the neighboring community in New
    Brunswick. This is almost a birthright for access across that border.
    That's how it's viewed in a lot of those border communities. And it's
    largely because they've existed for so long.


    Andrew Schwartz: So, this is why I didn't understand why during all these
    negotiations, the United States seem to be like arguing and fighting with
    Canada. Trudeau and Trump are trading fighting words. I mean, how can you
    fight with Canadians? They're nice people. They're our cousins like you
    just said so.


    Bill Reinsch: Well, but like Trudeau said, we're nice people but we can't
    be pushed around.


    Andrew Schwartz: Right. And Christina Freeland, the foreign minister
    absolutely can't be pushed around.


    Scott Miller: Well, Wade makes the very important point. That NAFTA was
    really about working together. We call it trade agreement. But it was
    really about making things together and then selling them to each other and
    the rest of the world. And that making things together and doing things
    together is particularly prominent in the Atlantic region, where these ties
    are deeper than the nationhood in some ways.


    Wade Merritt: Right. And I think, we run into issues when we're asked
    questions, particularly at the national level about how do you interact
    with Canada? Because it is very different than it is in other parts just
    because of that.


    Bill Reinsch: Fancy term for that is marketing and aggression.


    Wade Merritt: Yes.


    Bill Reinsch: And the whole point of NAFTA was to create an integrated
    North American market.


    Wade Merritt: Which it basically succeeded in. In many ways.


    Bill Reinsch: Yes. But the president doesn't like that. And so, that's why
    we've had gone through this whole exercise. We may probably end up still
    with an integrated market despite what he's trying to do.


    Andrew Schwartz: But do we have a better agreement now?


    Gabrielle Gerbaud: Well, we don't have an agreement yet.


    Andrew Schwartz: Yeah . . .Yeah. In your view, do we have a better
    agreement once it's signed?


    Gabrielle Gerbaud: I think so. We will have to see what happens. I mean if
    it's really what we think that is going to be. Because whatever result on
    the table right now, we don't know if it's going to be the final. So, for
    us whatever is been said until we don't see it the final version. Then we
    will be able to analyze it better. Right now we see it really as a
    modernization of the old, we need an agreement. That's for sure. And the
    uncertainty of not having one or working on a one that we know is going to
    end that's not helping us either. We're seeing the uncertainty is really
    bothering the business and the business community. People are not making
    choices. And businesses are just stopped and they're not making the
    decision and their plan for the next five and 10 years.


    Scott Miller: Well that's so, so important. I'm glad you brought it up.
    Because we were talking earlier about how trade is now prominent issue.
    Bill and I spent our whole careers on the back page of the business section
    and now we're front page above the fold. And that feels pretty good. That's
    a lot of fun. But the lack of predictability is insidious and it's hard to
    measure. Because nobody keeps track of the decisions that were made, okay?
    No-


    Bill Reinsch: Or the investment that was not made.


    Scott Miller: Or the investment was not made. Those decisions don't get
    tracked anywhere. They just disappear. So, even living in this sort of
    suspended animation for a little while here. How has that been? What has it
    done to your day to day jobs?


    Wade Merritt: Well, it's been interesting. I guess would probably be the
    best word for it. I mean, when it came to the USMCA you kind of came over
    as a tidal wave. I think as far as the state media, what's going to happen
    next and what's going on here. I mean, our-


    Andrew Schwartz: And by the way, what was wrong with the previous
    agreement?


    Wade Merritt: Right. All of that. And we could go down the list of things
    that people had issues with. Things like softwood lumber and that were not
    addressed in the earlier agreements. Still aren't addressed in this-


    Scott Miller: We call them the US Canada greatest hits. [laughter]


    Wade Merritt: Yes. It's the greatest hits. The ones that we bypass and
    don't [crosstalk 00:18:13].


    Bill Reinsch: A lot of them are our main lumber paper.


    Andrew Schwartz: Trade is not only front page now but it has greatest hits.
    [laughter]


    Wade Merritt: Yes. It's amazing, isn't it?


    Bill Reinsch: Yes. [crosstalk 00:18:22].


    Andrew Schwartz: [inaudible 00:18:22] Trade guys on Spotify by the way.


    Bill Reinsch: If we live long enough, we're going to get to golden oldies.
    Is that what you're saying?


    Andrew Schwartz: Yeah. We're getting to golden oldies pretty quick.


    Scott Miller: Because three generations of lawyers, children that have gone
    to college on the soft wood lumber dispute. So, longer it lasts.


    Andrew Schwartz: By the way am not kidding. Trade guys is on Spotify. It's
    on Apple podcasts. It's wherever you get your podcasts. And Yumi is going
    to tell me if I don't mention to this amazing audience and this very
    handsome audience by the way. To say-


    Scott Miller: Sounded like Trump, wow. Flatter them [laughter]


    Andrew Schwartz: It's a very gorgeous audience.


    Scott Miller: Luxurious.


    Andrew Schwartz: Yeah. You need to leave us a review. You did like us.
    Thank us. Leave us a review the whole deal. Anyway, I'm sorry.


    Bill Reinsch: So, I was interested in what you said. It probably is better
    if you're a state where there's a lot of automobile production or
    automobile parts production-


    Gabrielle Gerbaud: Which is


    Bill Reinsch: Which is not you. I suspect. It raises a whole bunch of other
    issues-


    Scott Miller: The digital economy sections might be good for the Internet
    of things and the other activities.


    Gabrielle Gerbaud: Transparency in the service area.


    Bill Reinsch: One issue that may make a difference. I mean despite the fact
    that the Canadians are inherently nice people, I could say my mother was
    Canadian, so she was nice. There is …


    Andrew Schwartz: She did a great job with raising Bill [laughter].


    Bill Reinsch: But that doesn't alter the fact that we've had a lot of
    fairly bitter trade disputes with them. A number of which involve Maine or
    actually the Northeast. There was lumber, there was paper, there've been
    lobster issues. There was Bombardier Boeing case that's Vermont-


    Scott Miller: Poultry.


    Bill Reinsch: Poultry. So, there's a lot of issues there. And one of the
    things this agreement does is it gets rid of the dispute settlement process
    with Canada. So, that your companies in both Minnesota and Maine are no
    longer going to be able to sue the Canadian government for anything it does
    is unfair. Does anybody care? Does that matter?


    Gabrielle Gerbaud: I don't think people are getting into the nitty, gritty
    yet. They just want something. And then once they understand that something
    ... once they have something, they will try to understand that something.
    And then they'll be able to complain or not.


    Andrew Schwartz: When do we expect we're going to get something?


    Bill Reinsch: I just had that question showed up on my phone this morning
    from somebody else. Seems to be going, getting … dragging out a bit. The
    shutdown slowed things down. We didn't have Q and A for Meredith. But the
    obvious question for Meredith was-


    Andrew Schwartz: This is Meredith Broadbent


    Bill Reinsch: Who was just here.


    Andrew Schwartz: the ITC commissioner who was just here. For those of you
    can't see and can't hear Meredith.


    Bill Reinsch: Well-


    Andrew Schwartz: That's right. Because this a podcast.


    Bill Reinsch: That's right. She was here immediately before us. And one of
    the timing factors here is that the international trade commission is
    charged with producing a report on the economic impact of the agreement.
    And they had 105 days to do that. Which had there not been a government
    shutdown would have been March 15th. And with the government shutdown, it's
    now been put off till April 17th. There's probably not a lot of visible
    things that are going to happen before then. Because most of the members of
    Congress will say, "How can we vote on something when we don't know if it's
    any good? We're going to wait for this independent body to give us an
    evaluation." What is going on right now and we've talked about this before,
    is the negotiation between the congress. Both sides of the Congress and
    both parties and the administration of what's going to be in it.


    Bill Reinsch: Because under the law, once the president formerly submits
    the implementing bill it cannot be changed. So, there's this elaborate pre
    submission game in which Congress attempts to tell the president “Here's
    what you should submit. And if you don't submit this then maybe we're not
    going to pass it.” The immediate issue ... I mean several issues would come
    up. The drug prices is one. There's a rather odd LBGTQ issue that has come
    up. The big one is labor and enforcement of labor has come up. But also the
    steel and aluminum tariffs which I think we want to ask the two of you
    about it.


    Andrew Schwartz: Yeah we want to talk about section 232 for sure


    Bill Reinsch: We've got a number of the members of Congress beginning with
    the chairman of the finance committee who has something to say about this.
    Say we really need to get rid of those. If this bill is going to move
    forward.


    Wade Merritt: Now to kind of put a point on this, tomorrow the public will
    get an idea tomorrow Wednesday. The public will get its first clue about
    how this dynamic is playing out. Because Ambassador Lighthizer will testify
    before the House Ways and Means Committee about the general trade agenda.
    So, I'm going to listen carefully for the questions and the answers about
    USMCA.


    Andrew Schwartz: Is he testifying-


    Scott Miller: No you not. Because you'll going to be spending all day with
    me. [laughter]


    Wade Merritt: [crosstalk 00:23:02] with Bill. But I've several hours left
    well I'm awake after we finish our conference.


    Andrew Schwartz: Is Lighthizer testifying at the same time as Michael
    Cohen.


    Wade Merritt: Well, that would [crosstalk 00:23:12] wouldn't it. I think it
    may be-


    Andrew Schwartz: Because of [inaudible 00:23:14]. I don't know if anybody's
    going to hear him. Because this town's waiting for that.


    Wade Merritt: I'm a trade guy. I only care about Ambassador Lighthizer.


    Andrew Schwartz: I hear. Well these guys ... yeah. By the way, tune in on
    Wednesday there's an amazing panel at CSIS and it's being streamed live,
    streamed all day long. Hank Paulson, Fred Smith, the CEO of FedEx, the
    Trade Guys and more.


    Bill Reinsch: Sue Schwab who was mentioned earlier.


    Andrew Schwartz: Sue Schwab. Yes.


    Bill Reinsch: But let's go back to [inaudible 00:23:35]. What about the
    tariffs. The steel and Aluminum tariffs-


    Andrew Schwartz: Sections 232.


    Bill Reinsch: Does this matter?


    Andrew Schwartz: First of all, Bill, explain what is section 232?


    Bill Reinsch: It's a provision of the trade expansion of 1962 that gives
    the president authority to limit imports if they threaten national
    security. And in the case of steel and aluminum, he determined following up
    a commerce study that recommended ... that found that there was a threat
    and recommend the President act. He acted. What is on the table right now
    is the same question, the same statute with respect to cars. And the
    Commerce Department has submitted its recommendation to the president which
    has not been made public. To my total astonishment there've been no leaks.
    I'm very disappointed. And the president has 90 days from last Sunday to
    act. Well actually the 17th, whenever that was … a week ago. To act and so,
    we may not know anything for quite a while.


    Scott Miller: Now on steel and aluminum the 25% tariff on steel and the 10%
    tariff on aluminum had been in place for roughly speaking a year. And there
    was a report yesterday from the American Iron and Steel Institute that
    indicated that the steel industry as a whole in the United States had
    reached the capacity utilization figure that was agreed to be the
    sustainable level. And they were not at before the tariffs. They are at
    after a year of tariffs-


    Bill Reinsch: Which is what, 80%?


    Scott Miller: 80% utilization of existing capacity. So, that may or may not
    factor into this. But certainly when it comes to Congress approving or
    working on USMCA, it appears that steel aluminum tariffs with Canada and
    Mexico are a threshold issue. How has that played out in your states?


    Wade Merritt: Well, I think, the first time that all of this started to
    kind of wash over our state was in June actually. The first media hits I
    think that I started getting from all of this was around July 6th. I think
    when the third round of retaliatory tariffs came in and lobster was on the
    list. And so, it was all about lobster, lobster, lobster. Because our
    lobster companies spends a lot of time and money trying to get into the
    lobster market. It quickly-


    Andrew Schwartz: Lobster's a national security issue.


    Wade Merritt: For the Chinese [laughter]. But then it quickly became ... we
    quickly ended up pivoting into what we still feel as the larger story.
    Which is the steel and aluminum tariffs and the effects on pretty much
    every small manufacturer in the state that needs to use it.


    Scott Miller: Prices went up.


    Wade Merritt: Prices went up. What's been interesting is that the companies
    have been talking a lot about it in private. But they have as yet been
    unwilling to kind of stand up and say, this is a problem for us. So, we
    kind of know that it's a problem from talking to them about it. They've
    somehow ... they've been able to kind of stay the course through this. But
    I think I would be surprised if you found anybody out there that was
    particularly happy about it.


    Scott Miller: Why aren’t they standing up complaining?


    Wade Merritt: For us, they just don't do that. Small companies don't do
    that for a lot of different reasons. Either they don't want to make
    themselves a target or they just frankly don't the time. I mean, if you're
    the president of a machine shop that has 25 employees, I'm not going to
    worry about going after national trade policy.


    Scott Miller: You got too busy day to do a PR campaign.


    Wade Merritt: Yeah. I’m too busy for that. Yeah.


    Scott Miller: Yeah. All right.


    Andrew Schwartz: Gabrielle, how about you? How's it impacting your state?


    Gabrielle Gerbaud: We are on analyzing the counter measures and how they're
    affecting the export of the state. And we've seen ... they were very
    amazing figures. Because if you imagined that this year it will be 2017
    exports. For example, the exports to China were affected 90% with the
    counter measures. So, that's a huge deal. But then for example, Canada,
    Mexico and EU were like 5%, 3.5% and 3%. Which, okay, it is important
    because from the moment it affects one business and one family we're all
    worried because those are the ones we're taking care of. However, in the
    scheme of things versus the 89% but 90% of the Chinese exports to the
    others. Well there is a big gap and a big difference between one and the
    others.


    Andrew Schwartz: So, is there a state level action to lobby the
    administration or Congress on these issues on your part?


    Gabrielle Gerbaud: We are listening but again they're not talking
    [laughter]. So, we're there to listen and we will be able to take action if
    we knew what action needed to be taken. I mean, we know, unfortunately it's
    not official. So, we cannot bring a list of companies saying this is the
    issues we're having. Let's do it. They can go directly to their
    representatives. But at the same time we don't have the official version of
    it. They don't want to talk.


    Andrew Schwartz: So, Trade Guys react to that. What does that make you
    think about?


    Scott Miller: Well, it's putting basically salespeople in a position of
    disadvantage. I mean, basically every state development director is a
    salesperson. They're selling their state to foreign investors, to companies
    purchasing exports, those kinds of things. And you're trying to accomplish
    that mission. And now life just got more complicated and your
    competitiveness drop maybe a scoch. And the companies you're trying to
    represent are little less happy with the circumstances. So, it seems like
    it's a headache you really didn't need. You seem to be bearing up well but-


    Wade Merritt: We've always kind of taken the approach in Maine of ... we've
    tried to meet the companies where they're at. And of course we will weigh
    and the congressional delegation will call us and ask us why we're feeling
    about things. And we'll pass along messages that we're hearing from the
    business community if they don't feel that they're in a position to kind of
    speak for themselves. But really our approach to all of this has been our
    jobs are to help the companies navigate the global trade policy no matter
    what it is, right? So, a lot of these, like I took a bunch of calls of
    people saying, "What am I going to do next?" Well, okay, let's figure this
    out together. It's counseling. I mean it's just [crosstalk 00:29:28].


    Scott Miller: So, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter who put the
    barrier there? You're trying to get rid of it or overcome it.


    Wade Merritt: We're trying to figure out a way to get over it. Yeah.


    Andrew Schwartz: What about the US/China trade tensions and what do we
    think's happening? Trade Guy, Bill? What do we think is happening?


    Bill Reinsch: Well, it's beginning to look more and more like allegedly
    happy ending. We'll see. I mean the president has been sending signals. He
    keeps saying we're very close to an agreement and he eliminated the tariff
    bump that was scheduled for this Friday. He didn't eliminate it. He
    postponed it to no specific date. He sending all these signals that he
    wants to sign an agreement. I think the argument will be whether it's a
    good agreement or not. And it's hard to say. I think the current
    speculation, keep in mind that those of us on the outside basically know
    nothing despite what people may claim from time to time. But it looks like
    this will be a package of four things. One, they're going to buy a bunch of
    stuff.


    Scott Miller: Market access.


    Bill Reinsch: And it'll be a big number and they'll arrive at a big number
    by having a whole bunch of years. So, I think the president has got to be
    over $1 trillion. Well, if you have enough years it's easy to get to a
    trillion. It'll probably be more than 10 years. So, and that's the Chinese
    have got no shortage of dollars right now. That's not a hard commitment for
    them to make. The hard commitment will be, what are we going to do on the
    so called structural issues? I think they'll be able to do some things on
    intellectual property protection and some things on some discrimination
    against American companies operating in China. Because they're in their
    interest to do it and because they've lost WTO cases. Or they're clearly
    under pressure from a lot of people. They're not going to do the
    fundamental things that the President wants them to do. In terms of
    eliminating subsidies, dropping their support for state owned enterprises
    basically turning our economy into a real market economy.


    Bill Reinsch: I think Xi Jinping has decided that they have two goals in
    China. Maintaining the party's control over the society and economic
    growth. And I think for him the priority is control first, growth second.
    And he believes in contrast to some of his predecessors that one of the
    ways to ensure that control is by increasing the party's control over the
    economy not decreasing it which is what he's doing. Credit private
    companies, small companies have been starved to credit than China. The SOEs
    are getting all that they want. This is not the way to grow and you can see
    it in their declining growth rate. But that's their policy. They're not
    going to do anything that is going to ... in his judgment, reduced control.


    Bill Reinsch: So, there'll be a smaller package. There'll be a bunch of
    enforcement. Item three, the bunch of enforcement provisions. Because
    Ambassador Lighthizer really believes in his heart of hearts that they're
    not going to do what they say they do and what they're going to do anyway.
    There'll be compliance issues. So, we need deadlines. We need from his
    perspective the United States needs to be able to unilaterally determine
    whether China is complying, no consultation, arbitration. We get to decide.
    And then if we decide they're not, then we get to unilaterally do things.
    Like put the tariffs back on or raise them depending on whether or not they
    go away.


    Bill Reinsch: Chinese not going to like that. That's one reason why we're
    not at the end yet. These are contentious issues. And then the fourth
    issue, bunch of cats and dogs. I think every time we have trade agreement
    people try to clean up outstanding issues. So, Huawei on the table, CTE is
    on the table. There is an issue well with Fujian Xinhua and Micron is on
    the table. There's a bunch of little things, beef, chickens.


    Bill Reinsch: The Chinese have some demands too and don't try to wrap maybe
    all that stuff up. The president I think wants a short term bump. If he
    reaches an agreement, the market is going to go crazy. Everybody's going to
    be very happy. Business will say, “ah the trade war is over.” Everybody's
    reassured. The real question is what's going to happen a year from now?
    Because for the President, the only path to real success is a good
    agreement. And one that Chinese comply with. And if a year later it turns
    out that neither of those conditions was met. We're right back where we
    started from. Which is the Chinese not compliant with not so good
    agreement. Nothing has changed for American business. And it's a lot closer
    to the election than it is now. People will have forgotten March of 2019.
    They're going to be thinking about March of 2020. And if you starts putting
    tariffs back on then because the Chinese haven't complied or bite back
    where we are now. So, I think it's very risky for him in the long term.


    Scott Miller: I agree. So, but at the moment with the president traveling
    to Vietnam to meet with Kim Jong Un. We have sort of have a brief
    intermission between act two and act three. But it's probably going to be a
    year before we know whether it's a self-farce or a comedy or whether it has
    a happy ending.


    Andrew Schwartz: Has the uncertainty affected your states? I mean, you've
    alluded to this a little bit that the uncertainty and other areas, how
    would the uncertainty with China? That's the big one.


    Gabrielle Gerbaud: First of all, you know, there are all these small
    companies that are asking questions and they are asking questions that
    they're very difficult to answer. But then they don't want to act upon it.
    Because they don't want to be visible. Because they are a little bit, I
    don't want to say scared. Scared is maybe a strong word. But they don't
    want to be [crosstalk 00:34:46] singled out. Exactly. They don't want to be
    singled out in the state. So, now they're just waiting. And as I said
    before, uncertainty, waiting, business doesn't go together. It just doesn't
    grow.


    Wade Merritt: For us, the big issue for China was the lobster industry. I
    can't continue to beat on that. I mean, the impact of the retaliatory
    tariffs were broad in Minnesota. In Maine they were very narrow but they
    were very deep. 99% of the impact of the Chinese retaliatory tariffs on the
    Maine economy were on the lobster industry. It was all lobster mostly.
    There was a couple of other smaller lines that were in there. This is again
    an investment that those companies had made over probably five or 10 years
    to access the market. 18% of our lobster exports were going to China at the
    time. So, it was a big deal for them. They found other ways to do it.
    They're looking at other Asian markets for places that they can put that.
    But that's not something that you can easily and quickly replace.


    Scott Miller: Have they repealed the state regulation which requires a
    maximum number of meals to inmates that are lobster? I think that's still
    on the books. They only feed the inmates lobsters so many times in the
    state prisons in Maine. [laughter]


    Wade Merritt: Yeah. It's a colonialist regulation. You are absolutely true.


    Bill Reinsch: Scott has an inexhaustible supply of facts [laughter].


    Andrew Schwartz: It's unbelievable, right? [laughter]


    Wade Merritt: Scott is absolutely right though. I mean this was a colonial
    era of regulation. You could only feed lobsters to inmates on a certain
    number of days.


    Andrew Schwartz: You might be the only person who really knows that stuff.


    Scott Miller: Well here we are. [laughter]


    Andrew Schwartz: I'm proud too. I'm proud to listen. Thank you all so much
    for being here with us for the trade guys. Thanks to our guests Gabrielle,
    Wade. It's been wonderful having you here. This Trade Guys episode will be
    posted within a day or so. Don't forget to listen to it. It'll be on

        Trade Guys on the Road: The State International Trade Development Organization Edition
February 28, 2019
    Scott Miller: I'm Scott.


    Bill Reinsch: I'm Bill.


    Scott Miller: And we're the trade guys.


    Bill Reinsch: And we're the trade guys.


    Andrew Schwartz: You're listening to the Trade Guys. A podcast produced by
    CSIS where we talk about trade in terms that everyone can understand. I'm
    H. Andrew Schwartz and I'm here with Scott Miller and Bill Reinsch the CSIS
    trade guys. In this episode we had the opportunity to record in front of an
    esteemed audience attending the State International Trade Development
    Organization or SIDO, they’re 2019 Washington forum. We did it up on
    Capitol Hill in the historic Russell Senate office building in a gorgeous,
    gorgeous room. Joining me and the Trade Guys were two State Trade Directors
    Gabrielle Gerbaud and Wade Merritt. Gabrielle is the executive director of
    the Minnesota Trade Office. Wade is the president of Maine's international
    trade center and a former SIDO president. We ask Gabrielle and Wade what
    they're hearing on the ground about USMCA about the U.S. China deal and
    about the section 232 tariffs. You'll get all that plus way more right here
    on this episode, live on Capitol Hill of the Trade Guys.


    Andrew Schwartz: We're here at small business committee. The last time Bill
    and Scott here, they were testifying, they were indicted, there were
    subpoenaed. But we're having them here under good terms. So, we're here at
    small business committee speaking at the State International Development
    Organization or SIDO their Washington forum. SIDO is a nonpartisan
    organization that's part of the NGA and the council state governments. They
    are the organization that represents the international trade directors for
    the governor and state. I love this setup. I feel like we're kind of being
    judged on the one hand. That we're being ... we're going to have to wave to
    our audience out here on the other hand.


    Scott Miller: In Portland, nobody has a gavel. We found that out. Yes.
    Right. So, we're safe for the moment [laughter].


    Andrew Schwartz: Okay. We're safe for the moment. We're joined by a couple
    of really wonderful guests, couple of state trade directors, Wade Merritt
    from Maine and Gabrielle Gerbaud from Minnesota. Thank you both for joining
    us. Wade, you're a past president of SIDO and had been with the Maine
    Department of Economic and community development for over 20 years. Why
    don't you tell us a little bit about SIDO and what state trade offices do.


    Wade Merritt: Well, thanks for having me on. Yeah, so it's been kind of a
    long strange trip. We were back in the early '90s. Found ourselves ... I
    think my first job in international trade development was photocopying
    lists of companies. That companies might be interested in doing business
    with and then faxing them. Things have changed quite a bit to find yourself
    on a podcast. But it's been a long trip. I started in the mid '90s. I was a
    frontline staff member, counseling companies. Have overtime worked my way
    up. Took the role as the state international trade director in June of
    2017. Really our jobs I think are to do exactly ... to connect our business
    community and our states really to international opportunities that can be
    in the area of export development. In our case, it also includes some work
    on the import side. And also on investment attraction and also a little bit
    on student attraction. It's a big job with a very big mandate. It's a big
    world. So, it's the idea for us is to try to make it small.


    Andrew Schwartz: And Gabrielle, you're the executive director of the
    Minnesota Trade Office, the state's official export development arm. Tell
    us what you do as director and what you're responsible for up there in
    Minnesota. And tell us how you brave the freezing cold. A couple of weeks
    ago I heard the people. I heard people's retinas were freezing and you had
    to go out with goggles on. If you were actually in public.


    Gabrielle Gerbaud: I didn't go out.


    Andrew Schwartz: Good, well your retinas look fantastic. [laughter]


    Gabrielle Gerbaud: That's why you have a heated garage.


    Andrew Schwartz: Yeah, I bet. [laughter]


    Gabrielle Gerbaud: Okay, And you layer. So, that's for that. For the trade
    matter, every day we have small and medium companies to export and to find
    the next opportunity worldwide. We do it through our ... now not only
    phenomenal team of experts that we have at the office of 10 people. But
    also with our offices internationally. That help us just find those
    opportunities. Also, we attract foreign investment and we tried to be the
    49th exceptional competence that we have with the other states. And finally
    we are the protocol office where we try to create those relationships at
    another level. That we facilitate at one point in time either trade or any
    memorandum or any future project.


    Bill Reinsch: Since we're here in the Russell Senate office building, do
    you guys work with your congressional delegations? What kind of support do
    you get from your congressional delegations? Or do you bypass them and work
    with the executive branch?


    Wade Merritt: Oh no, I think they're critical partners for us. I think, we
    have a very close relationship with all four of our congressional. We're a
    fairly small state with only four members. But which makes it easy for us
    to be able to talk with all of them. They've all been very supportive of
    us. We actually support each other pretty well in making sure that our
    voices are heard down here. But also in supporting the congressional
    offices as well. With some kind of on the ground intelligence about what's
    actually going on in the state with the business community.


    Gabrielle Gerbaud: Every year we create an amount of reports that are
    important to the state on the trade matters that we always share with our
    congressional delegation. We should be more active in the future. It has
    just changed. So, we're trying to educate everybody on what is available to
    them through our office. But there are key factor and there are key partner
    for us too.


    Bill Reinsch: Do you come to them for help? I mean, if you've got somebody
    who wants to export something somewhere and there was some obstacle, do you
    come to your senator or congressman and say, "Can you help us out with
    this?" Or can you go talk to the State Department or whoever it is in the
    executive branch? Or do you just go straight to the executive branch?


    Gabrielle Gerbaud: Actually we could but normally in Minnesota, because we
    have such an amount of a headquarters for fortune 500, they've gone
    directly. They have a relationship directly with the senators. So, they
    really don't need us for that.


    Bill Reinsch: Those are the big guys.


    Gabrielle Gerbaud: Those are the big guys.


    Bill Reinsch: But you're speaking for the small guy.


    Gabrielle Gerbaud: For the smaller guys, normally we've noticed that is
    much more powerful when they do it directly. At the end of the day they are
    the ones that vote. And we can facilitate the relationship. But at the end
    of the day, I think it's great that they speak up directly and they go
    after. And they just you know...


    Bill Reinsch: You can help do that.


    Gabrielle Gerbaud: Exactly, yes, of course.


    Bill Reinsch: Point them in the right direction.


    Wade Merritt: We're much smaller state with much smaller business
    community. We have zero fortune 500 companies that are located in our
    state. So-


    Andrew Schwartz: Great lobster rolls.


    Wade Merritt: Great lobster rolls, excellent craft beer and join us in the
    summertime. We'll see Bill there in a couple of minutes.


    Bill Reinsch: Coming in August. Yes.


    Scott Miller: The small states have their advantages.


    Wade Merritt: We do have our advantages and one of those is, easy access to
    our congressional delegation. In our case however, when we have a trade
    issue. We'll kind of judge whether the legislative route or the
    congressional route's the easier way to go. Or sometimes we'll bring in the
    executive through our work with our partner organization of the U.S.
    commercial service.


    Scott Miller: In former life, I used to lobby Senator Collins and senator
    Snowe. Because we had a main presence and first senator Snowe knew where
    every company was in Maine. She knew every town and every company in
    exhaustive knowledge. And then luckily we stumbled on the fact that the
    plant manager of our plant was a high school classmate of Susan Collins.
    So, Senator Collins had a particularly fondness for what we doing. But
    that's the small state edge in terms of your particularly senate
    representation and their deep knowledge of your specific situations.


    Wade Merritt: Well, I think that's right. And when senator Snowe retired
    and was replaced by former Governor King. Now Senator King was the governor
    that actually created our organization in the first place. He knew what
    we're doing. He knows what we're doing. And you're right. I mean, I think
    in Maine we're only a million and a half people, not even. The joke about
    the six degrees of separation in Maine it's about two. And I think you
    experience that when you ran into senator Collin's cousin.


    Bill Reinsch: I think that's true I experienced from the other perspective.
    I spent 20 years on the Hill. And most of them in this building actually
    working first for the senator from Pennsylvania and then for the senator
    from West Virginia.


    Andrew Schwartz: And senator Heinz and senator Rockefeller


    Bill Reinsch: And senator Heinz and senator Rockefeller. Right.
    Pennsylvania is a big state. It's got a lot of issues and getting the
    senator's attention was more complicated than West Virginia. Because there
    were fewer people coming in I think. And it was a lot ... a way easier I
    think for Rockefeller to do what Scott just said and what you just said and
    relocation of all these places and things just mattered more. Because there
    were fewer of them. Pennsylvania had a whole panoply of trade issues.
    Because everything that was important then in this country competed with
    somebody in Pennsylvania.


    Andrew Schwartz: You know what their biggest trade issue is right now. The
    Pittsburgh Steelers about to lose it. Antonio Brown and Le'Veon Bell
    they're the big trade issues. Am I right?


    Scott Miller: That is correct.


    Bill Reinsch: Heinz for a while on the Penguins.


    Scott Miller: Meanwhile, all my relatives are the Cleveland Browns in fan
    base.


    Andrew Schwartz: They're excited. I know.


    Wade Merritt: I got some in the back room


    Andrew Schwartz: But we digress. What are some of the biggest exports
    though from Maine?


    Wade Merritt: We're still very natural resource based. I mean this is the
    backbone of the Maine economy comes from the ocean and it comes from the
    forests. The both of those have been ... well although lobster industry has
    been seeing a pretty substantial growth. The forest products industry,
    let's just say we're in transition from kind of more traditional pulp and
    paper based. Forest based economy to what are we going to do with all this
    pulp. It's a lot of really interesting and new technologies that are coming
    out there. But that tends to be what drives us.


    Wade Merritt: We do have some smallish technology firms. We're close to
    Boston so, we've got a decent life sciences sector of people who've kind of
    made their way up the main turnpike. But our technology based sector also
    kind of flows itself back to our kind of traditional strengths. We've got a
    composites industry at advanced materials that comes directly from boat
    building. A lot of those types of things. So, still very natural resource
    based and niche manufacturing as well.


    Gabrielle Gerbaud: Well, we're not that poetic. I cannot talk about the
    forest and the ocean so badly-


    Bill Reinsch: Or the lobsters.


    Gabrielle Gerbaud: We've tried. We have ... Yeah. Try lobster from the
    lake. We have walleye. But it's of course, the medical industry, medical
    devices specifically for products, advanced manufacturing. Manufacturing's
    general. Vehicles, electric vehicles, plastics. We're very diverse economy.
    I think that that is one of our strengths. And also maybe you can always
    have the two sides of the coin. But a lot of agriculture and not only that
    but agrotechnology, the machinery that goes with it. Which is including
    manufacturing or the food … technology. So, we are very diverse in our
    industry.


    Scott Miller: Medical technology is a fascinating one because medical
    devices seem to be an industry that it's small inventors who become
    astonishingly successful when they get to get a product approved for use
    and then quickly have global mindset. So, it doesn't look like a typical
    company that scales up or an industry that gets scale. And then thinks
    about the global market. The medical device, it's first about invention.
    But the lot of little companies with amazing innovation pipelines who think
    about patients all over the world for their product. And so, it's somewhat
    unique. And what I'm wondering if does that have any spillovers and the
    rest of what goes on in terms of the human capital of Minnesota. Are there
    startups and companies that come out of the medical device industry that
    are in allied fields? Or something else that makes that intellectual home
    unique?


    Gabrielle Gerbaud: Yeah. That's an excellent question. Actually right now
    we have the commissioner of DEED, which is the Department of Employment
    Economic Development that is really focusing on startups right now because
    there is such a huge amount of startups in Minnesota devoted to those
    between many other things, Internet of things. Because I don't know if
    you've noticed, but right now instead of seeing verticals in terms of
    industry we're seeing almost diagonals. The industries are just crossing
    themselves. Internet of things is in the advanced manufacturing. They're
    not as clear as they used to be before. Before you belong to an industry
    and that's where you were stuck. Right now you're crossing industries one
    after the other. So, going to your-


    Andrew Schwartz: Interesting point.


    Wade Merritt: It's a very good point.


    Gabrielle Gerbaud: Coming back to your question, I think there is that kind
    of cradle. Again of course from Minnesota, always unknown to the world. But
    there is that kind of cradle that they're really ... those startups they're
    becoming a more and more important. Because then they have those huge
    companies that Medtronic like Start Hearing. That they really ... either
    they use their products. They use the technology or they just purchased
    them. It's kind of a little bit of an ecosystem that is happening right now
    in Minnesota. Yes


    Wade Merritt: Fascinating.


    Andrew Schwartz: In both of your states, how important is NAFTA or the new
    USMCA to your state? And how has it affected your economy? How's it been a
    net positive or has it harmed your state? And this is something we've been
    talking on the Trade Guys for a long time. I know both of our trade guys
    want to weigh in on this.


    Bill Reinsch: Well you're both border states actually.


    Wade Merritt: Yeah.


    Gabrielle Gerbaud: We are.


    Bill Reinsch: So, largest trading partners is Canada and then the second
    largest probably Mexico at least for us.


    Wade Merritt:So Yeah. Mexico is a top 10 market. But Canada definitely
    dominates the scene for us. It is 50% of what the state exports goes to
    Canada. If you break the provinces out individually, New Brunswick's number
    one. Quebec is number two. And then I think it's China number three.


    Bill Reinsch: That’s a province of Canada right? [laughter]


    Wade Merritt: Right that's a province of Canada. Yeah. No.


    Andrew Schwartz: Are you implying that the Canadians want to annex Maine?


    Bill Reinsch: No, they want to annex China.


    Wade Merritt: Lets edit this part out. [laughter]


    Scott Miller: Those border wars were contentious at one point. [laughter]


    Wade Merritt: No, but that's an interesting point though. And one that I
    was going to make actually is that, in our case Maine, New Brunswick,
    Quebec existed before there was even a country. I mean, this was in a lot
    of ways, this was a line that was drawn through an existing economy. There
    are family ties, there are business connections, there are all sorts of
    ties that cross that border.


    Scott Miller: That's a great point. When I speak to student groups, I have
    a question. When did free trade in North America began? And the grinders
    will say 1995 or 1994 when NAFTA went into force. And the clever ones will
    say, well, sometime before 1789.


    Wade Merritt: Yeah. I mean, it kind of gets into our mindset and our psyche
    a little bit. I mean, I think that there's certainly a picture from our
    Maine perspective that the folks in Atlanta, Canada and Quebec are more of
    our cousins and our business partners. The disputes that happen between
    those jurisdictions tend to be more familial. They tend to be kind of
    small. Access to that market whether it's you're going over there to do
    business. Or in some cases when we were talking about instituting passport
    control for the northern border. You were talking about people having to
    have their passport to go to church in the neighboring community in New
    Brunswick. This is almost a birthright for access across that border.
    That's how it's viewed in a lot of those border communities. And it's
    largely because they've existed for so long.


    Andrew Schwartz: So, this is why I didn't understand why during all these
    negotiations, the United States seem to be like arguing and fighting with
    Canada. Trudeau and Trump are trading fighting words. I mean, how can you
    fight with Canadians? They're nice people. They're our cousins like you
    just said so.


    Bill Reinsch: Well, but like Trudeau said, we're nice people but we can't
    be pushed around.


    Andrew Schwartz: Right. And Christina Freeland, the foreign minister
    absolutely can't be pushed around.


    Scott Miller: Well, Wade makes the very important point. That NAFTA was
    really about working together. We call it trade agreement. But it was
    really about making things together and then selling them to each other and
    the rest of the world. And that making things together and doing things
    together is particularly prominent in the Atlantic region, where these ties
    are deeper than the nationhood in some ways.


    Wade Merritt: Right. And I think, we run into issues when we're asked
    questions, particularly at the national level about how do you interact
    with Canada? Because it is very different than it is in other parts just
    because of that.


    Bill Reinsch: Fancy term for that is marketing and aggression.


    Wade Merritt: Yes.


    Bill Reinsch: And the whole point of NAFTA was to create an integrated
    North American market.


    Wade Merritt: Which it basically succeeded in. In many ways.


    Bill Reinsch: Yes. But the president doesn't like that. And so, that's why
    we've had gone through this whole exercise. We may probably end up still
    with an integrated market despite what he's trying to do.


    Andrew Schwartz: But do we have a better agreement now?


    Gabrielle Gerbaud: Well, we don't have an agreement yet.


    Andrew Schwartz: Yeah . . .Yeah. In your view, do we have a better
    agreement once it's signed?


    Gabrielle Gerbaud: I think so. We will have to see what happens. I mean if
    it's really what we think that is going to be. Because whatever result on
    the table right now, we don't know if it's going to be the final. So, for
    us whatever is been said until we don't see it the final version. Then we
    will be able to analyze it better. Right now we see it really as a
    modernization of the old, we need an agreement. That's for sure. And the
    uncertainty of not having one or working on a one that we know is going to
    end that's not helping us either. We're seeing the uncertainty is really
    bothering the business and the business community. People are not making
    choices. And businesses are just stopped and they're not making the
    decision and their plan for the next five and 10 years.


    Scott Miller: Well that's so, so important. I'm glad you brought it up.
    Because we were talking earlier about how trade is now prominent issue.
    Bill and I spent our whole careers on the back page of the business section
    and now we're front page above the fold. And that feels pretty good. That's
    a lot of fun. But the lack of predictability is insidious and it's hard to
    measure. Because nobody keeps track of the decisions that were made, okay?
    No-


    Bill Reinsch: Or the investment that was not made.


    Scott Miller: Or the investment was not made. Those decisions don't get
    tracked anywhere. They just disappear. So, even living in this sort of
    suspended animation for a little while here. How has that been? What has it
    done to your day to day jobs?


    Wade Merritt: Well, it's been interesting. I guess would probably be the
    best word for it. I mean, when it came to the USMCA you kind of came over
    as a tidal wave. I think as far as the state media, what's going to happen
    next and what's going on here. I mean, our-


    Andrew Schwartz: And by the way, what was wrong with the previous
    agreement?


    Wade Merritt: Right. All of that. And we could go down the list of things
    that people had issues with. Things like softwood lumber and that were not
    addressed in the earlier agreements. Still aren't addressed in this-


    Scott Miller: We call them the US Canada greatest hits. [laughter]


    Wade Merritt: Yes. It's the greatest hits. The ones that we bypass and
    don't [crosstalk 00:18:13].


    Bill Reinsch: A lot of them are our main lumber paper.


    Andrew Schwartz: Trade is not only front page now but it has greatest hits.
    [laughter]


    Wade Merritt: Yes. It's amazing, isn't it?


    Bill Reinsch: Yes. [crosstalk 00:18:22].


    Andrew Schwartz: [inaudible 00:18:22] Trade guys on Spotify by the way.


    Bill Reinsch: If we live long enough, we're going to get to golden oldies.
    Is that what you're saying?


    Andrew Schwartz: Yeah. We're getting to golden oldies pretty quick.


    Scott Miller: Because three generations of lawyers, children that have gone
    to college on the soft wood lumber dispute. So, longer it lasts.


    Andrew Schwartz: By the way am not kidding. Trade guys is on Spotify. It's
    on Apple podcasts. It's wherever you get your podcasts. And Yumi is going
    to tell me if I don't mention to this amazing audience and this very
    handsome audience by the way. To say-


    Scott Miller: Sounded like Trump, wow. Flatter them [laughter]


    Andrew Schwartz: It's a very gorgeous audience.


    Scott Miller: Luxurious.


    Andrew Schwartz: Yeah. You need to leave us a review. You did like us.
    Thank us. Leave us a review the whole deal. Anyway, I'm sorry.


    Bill Reinsch: So, I was interested in what you said. It probably is better
    if you're a state where there's a lot of automobile production or
    automobile parts production-


    Gabrielle Gerbaud: Which is


    Bill Reinsch: Which is not you. I suspect. It raises a whole bunch of other
    issues-


    Scott Miller: The digital economy sections might be good for the Internet
    of things and the other activities.


    Gabrielle Gerbaud: Transparency in the service area.


    Bill Reinsch: One issue that may make a difference. I mean despite the fact
    that the Canadians are inherently nice people, I could say my mother was
    Canadian, so she was nice. There is …


    Andrew Schwartz: She did a great job with raising Bill [laughter].


    Bill Reinsch: But that doesn't alter the fact that we've had a lot of
    fairly bitter trade disputes with them. A number of which involve Maine or
    actually the Northeast. There was lumber, there was paper, there've been
    lobster issues. There was Bombardier Boeing case that's Vermont-


    Scott Miller: Poultry.


    Bill Reinsch: Poultry. So, there's a lot of issues there. And one of the
    things this agreement does is it gets rid of the dispute settlement process
    with Canada. So, that your companies in both Minnesota and Maine are no
    longer going to be able to sue the Canadian government for anything it does
    is unfair. Does anybody care? Does that matter?


    Gabrielle Gerbaud: I don't think people are getting into the nitty, gritty
    yet. They just want something. And then once they understand that something
    ... once they have something, they will try to understand that something.
    And then they'll be able to complain or not.


    Andrew Schwartz: When do we expect we're going to get something?


    Bill Reinsch: I just had that question showed up on my phone this morning
    from somebody else. Seems to be going, getting … dragging out a bit. The
    shutdown slowed things down. We didn't have Q and A for Meredith. But the
    obvious question for Meredith was-


    Andrew Schwartz: This is Meredith Broadbent


    Bill Reinsch: Who was just here.


    Andrew Schwartz: the ITC commissioner who was just here. For those of you
    can't see and can't hear Meredith.


    Bill Reinsch: Well-


    Andrew Schwartz: That's right. Because this a podcast.


    Bill Reinsch: That's right. She was here immediately before us. And one of
    the timing factors here is that the international trade commission is
    charged with producing a report on the economic impact of the agreement.
    And they had 105 days to do that. Which had there not been a government
    shutdown would have been March 15th. And with the government shutdown, it's
    now been put off till April 17th. There's probably not a lot of visible
    things that are going to happen before then. Because most of the members of
    Congress will say, "How can we vote on something when we don't know if it's
    any good? We're going to wait for this independent body to give us an
    evaluation." What is going on right now and we've talked about this before,
    is the negotiation between the congress. Both sides of the Congress and
    both parties and the administration of what's going to be in it.


    Bill Reinsch: Because under the law, once the president formerly submits
    the implementing bill it cannot be changed. So, there's this elaborate pre
    submission game in which Congress attempts to tell the president “Here's
    what you should submit. And if you don't submit this then maybe we're not
    going to pass it.” The immediate issue ... I mean several issues would come
    up. The drug prices is one. There's a rather odd LBGTQ issue that has come
    up. The big one is labor and enforcement of labor has come up. But also the
    steel and aluminum tariffs which I think we want to ask the two of you
    about it.


    Andrew Schwartz: Yeah we want to talk about section 232 for sure


    Bill Reinsch: We've got a number of the members of Congress beginning with
    the chairman of the finance committee who has something to say about this.
    Say we really need to get rid of those. If this bill is going to move
    forward.


    Wade Merritt: Now to kind of put a point on this, tomorrow the public will
    get an idea tomorrow Wednesday. The public will get its first clue about
    how this dynamic is playing out. Because Ambassador Lighthizer will testify
    before the House Ways and Means Committee about the general trade agenda.
    So, I'm going to listen carefully for the questions and the answers about
    USMCA.


    Andrew Schwartz: Is he testifying-


    Scott Miller: No you not. Because you'll going to be spending all day with
    me. [laughter]


    Wade Merritt: [crosstalk 00:23:02] with Bill. But I've several hours left
    well I'm awake after we finish our conference.


    Andrew Schwartz: Is Lighthizer testifying at the same time as Michael
    Cohen.


    Wade Merritt: Well, that would [crosstalk 00:23:12] wouldn't it. I think it
    may be-


    Andrew Schwartz: Because of [inaudible 00:23:14]. I don't know if anybody's
    going to hear him. Because this town's waiting for that.


    Wade Merritt: I'm a trade guy. I only care about Ambassador Lighthizer.


    Andrew Schwartz: I hear. Well these guys ... yeah. By the way, tune in on
    Wednesday there's an amazing panel at CSIS and it's being streamed live,
    streamed all day long. Hank Paulson, Fred Smith, the CEO of FedEx, the
    Trade Guys and more.


    Bill Reinsch: Sue Schwab who was mentioned earlier.


    Andrew Schwartz: Sue Schwab. Yes.


    Bill Reinsch: But let's go back to [inaudible 00:23:35]. What about the
    tariffs. The steel and Aluminum tariffs-


    Andrew Schwartz: Sections 232.


    Bill Reinsch: Does this matter?


    Andrew Schwartz: First of all, Bill, explain what is section 232?


    Bill Reinsch: It's a provision of the trade expansion of 1962 that gives
    the president authority to limit imports if they threaten national
    security. And in the case of steel and aluminum, he determined following up
    a commerce study that recommended ... that found that there was a threat
    and recommend the President act. He acted. What is on the table right now
    is the same question, the same statute with respect to cars. And the
    Commerce Department has submitted its recommendation to the president which
    has not been made public. To my total astonishment there've been no leaks.
    I'm very disappointed. And the president has 90 days from last Sunday to
    act. Well actually the 17th, whenever that was … a week ago. To act and so,
    we may not know anything for quite a while.


    Scott Miller: Now on steel and aluminum the 25% tariff on steel and the 10%
    tariff on aluminum had been in place for roughly speaking a year. And there
    was a report yesterday from the American Iron and Steel Institute that
    indicated that the steel industry as a whole in the United States had
    reached the capacity utilization figure that was agreed to be the
    sustainable level. And they were not at before the tariffs. They are at
    after a year of tariffs-


    Bill Reinsch: Which is what, 80%?


    Scott Miller: 80% utilization of existing capacity. So, that may or may not
    factor into this. But certainly when it comes to Congress approving or
    working on USMCA, it appears that steel aluminum tariffs with Canada and
    Mexico are a threshold issue. How has that played out in your states?


    Wade Merritt: Well, I think, the first time that all of this started to
    kind of wash over our state was in June actually. The first media hits I
    think that I started getting from all of this was around July 6th. I think
    when the third round of retaliatory tariffs came in and lobster was on the
    list. And so, it was all about lobster, lobster, lobster. Because our
    lobster companies spends a lot of time and money trying to get into the
    lobster market. It quickly-


    Andrew Schwartz: Lobster's a national security issue.


    Wade Merritt: For the Chinese [laughter]. But then it quickly became ... we
    quickly ended up pivoting into what we still feel as the larger story.
    Which is the steel and aluminum tariffs and the effects on pretty much
    every small manufacturer in the state that needs to use it.


    Scott Miller: Prices went up.


    Wade Merritt: Prices went up. What's been interesting is that the companies
    have been talking a lot about it in private. But they have as yet been
    unwilling to kind of stand up and say, this is a problem for us. So, we
    kind of know that it's a problem from talking to them about it. They've
    somehow ... they've been able to kind of stay the course through this. But
    I think I would be surprised if you found anybody out there that was
    particularly happy about it.


    Scott Miller: Why aren’t they standing up complaining?


    Wade Merritt: For us, they just don't do that. Small companies don't do
    that for a lot of different reasons. Either they don't want to make
    themselves a target or they just frankly don't the time. I mean, if you're
    the president of a machine shop that has 25 employees, I'm not going to
    worry about going after national trade policy.


    Scott Miller: You got too busy day to do a PR campaign.


    Wade Merritt: Yeah. I’m too busy for that. Yeah.


    Scott Miller: Yeah. All right.


    Andrew Schwartz: Gabrielle, how about you? How's it impacting your state?


    Gabrielle Gerbaud: We are on analyzing the counter measures and how they're
    affecting the export of the state. And we've seen ... they were very
    amazing figures. Because if you imagined that this year it will be 2017
    exports. For example, the exports to China were affected 90% with the
    counter measures. So, that's a huge deal. But then for example, Canada,
    Mexico and EU were like 5%, 3.5% and 3%. Which, okay, it is important
    because from the moment it affects one business and one family we're all
    worried because those are the ones we're taking care of. However, in the
    scheme of things versus the 89% but 90% of the Chinese exports to the
    others. Well there is a big gap and a big difference between one and the
    others.


    Andrew Schwartz: So, is there a state level action to lobby the
    administration or Congress on these issues on your part?


    Gabrielle Gerbaud: We are listening but again they're not talking
    [laughter]. So, we're there to listen and we will be able to take action if
    we knew what action needed to be taken. I mean, we know, unfortunately it's
    not official. So, we cannot bring a list of companies saying this is the
    issues we're having. Let's do it. They can go directly to their
    representatives. But at the same time we don't have the official version of
    it. They don't want to talk.


    Andrew Schwartz: So, Trade Guys react to that. What does that make you
    think about?


    Scott Miller: Well, it's putting basically salespeople in a position of
    disadvantage. I mean, basically every state development director is a
    salesperson. They're selling their state to foreign investors, to companies
    purchasing exports, those kinds of things. And you're trying to accomplish
    that mission. And now life just got more complicated and your
    competitiveness drop maybe a scoch. And the companies you're trying to
    represent are little less happy with the circumstances. So, it seems like
    it's a headache you really didn't need. You seem to be bearing up well but-


    Wade Merritt: We've always kind of taken the approach in Maine of ... we've
    tried to meet the companies where they're at. And of course we will weigh
    and the congressional delegation will call us and ask us why we're feeling
    about things. And we'll pass along messages that we're hearing from the
    business community if they don't feel that they're in a position to kind of
    speak for themselves. But really our approach to all of this has been our
    jobs are to help the companies navigate the global trade policy no matter
    what it is, right? So, a lot of these, like I took a bunch of calls of
    people saying, "What am I going to do next?" Well, okay, let's figure this
    out together. It's counseling. I mean it's just [crosstalk 00:29:28].


    Scott Miller: So, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter who put the
    barrier there? You're trying to get rid of it or overcome it.


    Wade Merritt: We're trying to figure out a way to get over it. Yeah.


    Andrew Schwartz: What about the US/China trade tensions and what do we
    think's happening? Trade Guy, Bill? What do we think is happening?


    Bill Reinsch: Well, it's beginning to look more and more like allegedly
    happy ending. We'll see. I mean the president has been sending signals. He
    keeps saying we're very close to an agreement and he eliminated the tariff
    bump that was scheduled for this Friday. He didn't eliminate it. He
    postponed it to no specific date. He sending all these signals that he
    wants to sign an agreement. I think the argument will be whether it's a
    good agreement or not. And it's hard to say. I think the current
    speculation, keep in mind that those of us on the outside basically know
    nothing despite what people may claim from time to time. But it looks like
    this will be a package of four things. One, they're going to buy a bunch of
    stuff.


    Scott Miller: Market access.


    Bill Reinsch: And it'll be a big number and they'll arrive at a big number
    by having a whole bunch of years. So, I think the president has got to be
    over $1 trillion. Well, if you have enough years it's easy to get to a
    trillion. It'll probably be more than 10 years. So, and that's the Chinese
    have got no shortage of dollars right now. That's not a hard commitment for
    them to make. The hard commitment will be, what are we going to do on the
    so called structural issues? I think they'll be able to do some things on
    intellectual property protection and some things on some discrimination
    against American companies operating in China. Because they're in their
    interest to do it and because they've lost WTO cases. Or they're clearly
    under pressure from a lot of people. They're not going to do the
    fundamental things that the President wants them to do. In terms of
    eliminating subsidies, dropping their support for state owned enterprises
    basically turning our economy into a real market economy.


    Bill Reinsch: I think Xi Jinping has decided that they have two goals in
    China. Maintaining the party's control over the society and economic
    growth. And I think for him the priority is control first, growth second.
    And he believes in contrast to some of his predecessors that one of the
    ways to ensure that control is by increasing the party's control over the
    economy not decreasing it which is what he's doing. Credit private
    companies, small companies have been starved to credit than China. The SOEs
    are getting all that they want. This is not the way to grow and you can see
    it in their declining growth rate. But that's their policy. They're not
    going to do anything that is going to ... in his judgment, reduced control.


    Bill Reinsch: So, there'll be a smaller package. There'll be a bunch of
    enforcement. Item three, the bunch of enforcement provisions. Because
    Ambassador Lighthizer really believes in his heart of hearts that they're
    not going to do what they say they do and what they're going to do anyway.
    There'll be compliance issues. So, we need deadlines. We need from his
    perspective the United States needs to be able to unilaterally determine
    whether China is complying, no consultation, arbitration. We get to decide.
    And then if we decide they're not, then we get to unilaterally do things.
    Like put the tariffs back on or raise them depending on whether or not they
    go away.


    Bill Reinsch: Chinese not going to like that. That's one reason why we're
    not at the end yet. These are contentious issues. And then the fourth
    issue, bunch of cats and dogs. I think every time we have trade agreement
    people try to clean up outstanding issues. So, Huawei on the table, CTE is
    on the table. There is an issue well with Fujian Xinhua and Micron is on
    the table. There's a bunch of little things, beef, chickens.


    Bill Reinsch: The Chinese have some demands too and don't try to wrap maybe
    all that stuff up. The president I think wants a short term bump. If he
    reaches an agreement, the market is going to go crazy. Everybody's going to
    be very happy. Business will say, “ah the trade war is over.” Everybody's
    reassured. The real question is what's going to happen a year from now?
    Because for the President, the only path to real success is a good
    agreement. And one that Chinese comply with. And if a year later it turns
    out that neither of those conditions was met. We're right back where we
    started from. Which is the Chinese not compliant with not so good
    agreement. Nothing has changed for American business. And it's a lot closer
    to the election than it is now. People will have forgotten March of 2019.
    They're going to be thinking about March of 2020. And if you starts putting
    tariffs back on then because the Chinese haven't complied or bite back
    where we are now. So, I think it's very risky for him in the long term.


    Scott Miller: I agree. So, but at the moment with the president traveling
    to Vietnam to meet with Kim Jong Un. We have sort of have a brief
    intermission between act two and act three. But it's probably going to be a
    year before we know whether it's a self-farce or a comedy or whether it has
    a happy ending.


    Andrew Schwartz: Has the uncertainty affected your states? I mean, you've
    alluded to this a little bit that the uncertainty and other areas, how
    would the uncertainty with China? That's the big one.


    Gabrielle Gerbaud: First of all, you know, there are all these small
    companies that are asking questions and they are asking questions that
    they're very difficult to answer. But then they don't want to act upon it.
    Because they don't want to be visible. Because they are a little bit, I
    don't want to say scared. Scared is maybe a strong word. But they don't
    want to be [crosstalk 00:34:46] singled out. Exactly. They don't want to be
    singled out in the state. So, now they're just waiting. And as I said
    before, uncertainty, waiting, business doesn't go together. It just doesn't
    grow.


    Wade Merritt: For us, the big issue for China was the lobster industry. I
    can't continue to beat on that. I mean, the impact of the retaliatory
    tariffs were broad in Minnesota. In Maine they were very narrow but they
    were very deep. 99% of the impact of the Chinese retaliatory tariffs on the
    Maine economy were on the lobster industry. It was all lobster mostly.
    There was a couple of other smaller lines that were in there. This is again
    an investment that those companies had made over probably five or 10 years
    to access the market. 18% of our lobster exports were going to China at the
    time. So, it was a big deal for them. They found other ways to do it.
    They're looking at other Asian markets for places that they can put that.
    But that's not something that you can easily and quickly replace.


    Scott Miller: Have they repealed the state regulation which requires a
    maximum number of meals to inmates that are lobster? I think that's still
    on the books. They only feed the inmates lobsters so many times in the
    state prisons in Maine. [laughter]


    Wade Merritt: Yeah. It's a colonialist regulation. You are absolutely true.


    Bill Reinsch: Scott has an inexhaustible supply of facts [laughter].


    Andrew Schwartz: It's unbelievable, right? [laughter]


    Wade Merritt: Scott is absolutely right though. I mean this was a colonial
    era of regulation. You could only feed lobsters to inmates on a certain
    number of days.


    Andrew Schwartz: You might be the only person who really knows that stuff.


    Scott Miller: Well here we are. [laughter]
