Rapid technological advancements offer a wealth of potential opportunities for business and consumers, but also present a set of serious public policy challenges for the United States, China and others. Maximizing the benefits of innovation requires strong support for R&D and open markets, and policies and practices that effectively protect intellectual property rights, privacy, and national security.
 
Recognizing the difficulty of this multi-pronged pursuit, at our April 10 kickoff event, American and Chinese representatives from industry, finance, government and think tanks will discuss how to best foster, protect, and advance innovation.
 
The US-China Innovation Forum is a joint initiative of the CSIS Freeman Chair in China Studies and the US-China Business Council.
 
Confirmed speakers currently include individuals from the following organizations:
 

	C&M International
	Cummins Corporation
	I-Mab Biopharma
