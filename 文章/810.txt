orum: The Future of China's Bond Market 
      Wednesday, March 13, 2019 2:00 pm - 3:30 pmCSIS Headquarters 2nd Floor Conference Center  


China’s bond market, which has been growing by leaps and bounds, is destined to play an increasingly important role at home and abroad, and the inclusion of its bonds in global indices will be a positive milestone for its financial market integration. For policymakers and investors alike, this calls for a good understanding of the bond market structure, its unique characteristics, and areas for reform. This event presents the findings from the IMF’s latest work on the topic, The Future of China’s Bond Market, which analyzes all of the major segments of China’s bond market, including sovereign bonds, corporate bonds and local government bonds. Following opening remarks from Deputy Managing Director David Lipton, several of the contributors, led by the IMF’s chief representative in China Alfred Schipke, will present the book’s main findings. Former U.S. Treasury official and US Representative to the IMF Mark Sobel will then offer some initial commentary, before opening up the discussion with the audience.
