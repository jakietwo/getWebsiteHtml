              Arms control and the nonproliferation regime are being challenged on multiple fronts. U.S.-Russia bilateral cooperation on arms control stalled under the cloud of INF violations by Russia and withdrawal by the United States. Prospects for even simple extension of the New START Treaty appear grim. If New START expires in 2021 without extension or replacement the United States may find itself for the first time in over fifty years without any formal, treaty-based limits on strategic nuclear weapons capabilities. This uncertainty combined with nuclear modernization programs in U.S., Russia and China raise important questions about the future strategic stability, force modernization and arms control.
 Please join PONI on April 3, 2019 for a half-day conference from 1-5pm to explore the future of arms control. The conference will be followed by a reception. Additional speakers and specific times will be announced shortly.
 Agenda Panel 1: Arms Control and Strategic Stability in Europe and Asia Ulrich Kuehn, Deputy Head, Arms Control and Emerging Technologies, Institute for Peace Research and Security Policy, University of Hamburg Rebecca Lissner, Assistant Professor, Strategic and Operational Research Department, U.S. Naval War College John Warden, Strategy, Forces and Resource Division, Institute for Defense Analyses   Panel 2: Force Posture Implications of a Post-Arms Control World Alex Bell, Senior Policy Director, Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation Vince Manzo, Research Scientist, Center for Naval Analyses Frank Rose, Senior Fellow for Security and Strategy, Foreign Policy, Brookings Institution   This event is made possible by support from Northrop Grumman Corporation.
