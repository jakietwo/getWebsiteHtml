ening: Vietnam Summit, India Pakistan, Manish Boy and More
February 27, 2019Vietnam Summit
President Trump kicked off the Vietnam Summit with Kim Jong Un with a one-on-one pre-dinner chat at a hotel in Hanoi. After shaking hands with. Kim, Trump said he had a “great relationship” with the North Korean dictator. He said he would help North Korea rapidly become an economic powerhouse—if only it would give up its atomic weapons and the facilities to develop them, as the WSJ’s Michael Gordon, Vivian Salama and Jonathan Cheng  report.
 And, as Reuters  reports, the White House barred reporters from Reuters, the Associated Press and Bloomberg from covering the dinner between President Trump and Kim Jong Un after two of them asked Trump questions during his initial interactions with Kim.
