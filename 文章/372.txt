        China's Energy Future
The Middle Kingdom Seeks Its Place in the SunNovember 1, 2005ISBN# 0-89206-473-0 (pb)CSISChina, because of its voracious appetite for oil, has become part of the "new game" redefining the world oil industry. China is second only to the United States in consumption of oil and electric power, and its coal industry leads the world in annual output. But with growth in domestic crude oil production questionable, China's expanding economy requires more and more foreign oil. World oil prices, of course, are at historically high levels and, barring unforeseen circumstances, are expected to hold there for some time. China, therefore, is now struggling to find the right combination of market incentives, conservation policies, pollution abatement efforts, and energy supply diversification to guarantee adequate energy supplies, while protecting the country's national security and controlling its reliance on oil imports. With this volume, energy expert Robert Ebel analyzes Chinaâ€™s current energy situation and looks at its future in the increasingly dynamic world energy market.

Robert E. Ebel is chairman of the CSIS Energy Program and the editor of Caspian Oil Windfalls (Open Society Institute, 2003), coeditor of Energy and Conflict in Central Asia and the Caucasus (Rowman & Littlefield, 2000), and author of Energy Choices in the Near Abroad (CSIS, 1997).
