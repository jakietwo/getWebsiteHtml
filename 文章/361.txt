Media Highlights

"There is a strong fear of complacency, that people have become so used to the United States achieving what it wants in the world, to include militarily, that it isn't heeding the warning signs. It's the flashing red that we are trying to relay." - Kathleen H. Hicks in  The Washington Post   on November 14, 2018.

"We were a leader and now we are a laggard, stuck with expensive manned options and not doing nearly the experimentation and learning we need to. We'll need to watch and learn from China and others now." - Sam Brannen in  Defense One   on November 6, 2018.

"Russia appears to be using air defense sales within much bigger political and economic frameworks. In some cases, the purchase of S-400 looks a bit like what the ancient Romans called tribute." - Tom Karako in   CNBC   on November 14, 2018.

"You don't need to worry about a dull period. I don't know that control [of Congress] is the issue. I think it might well be the partisanship of both houses and how hard it may be to agree on anything, move things forward, and avoid turning every foreign policy issue into a partisan issue." - Anthony Cordesman in   VOA   on November 7, 2018.

â€œIt would be smart to drive home the importance of standing up the first new operational component since DHS' establishment by giving them a facility to house the entire mission." - Suzanne Spaulding in  Inside Cybersecurity   on November 15, 2018.

"This is going to turn out to be a huge disappointment to people watching DoD. They're going to expect billions of dollars in misspent money, but that's unlikely to materialize. DoD knows exactly where it spends its money ." -Mark Cancian in  Breaking Defense   on November 14, 2018.
